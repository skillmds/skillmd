# X (Twitter) — Tweet Search & Scraper

> Search query / handle / URL → structured tweet list (text, author, metrics, media, entities)

## Language

All process output to user (progress updates, process notifications) follows the user's language.

## Objective

Collect tweets matching a search query, from specific user profiles, or from direct URLs, extracting complete structured data for each tweet.

## Prerequisites

- Target page is already open in the browser: `https://x.com/search?q=...` or `https://x.com/{handle}` or a direct tweet/list URL
- User must be logged in to X (user avatar or username visible in left sidebar)

## Pre-execution Checks

### 1. Tool Readiness

If browser-act has been confirmed available in the current session → skip this step.

Invoke `browser-act` via Skill tool to load usage. If installation or configuration issues arise, follow its guidance to resolve then retry.

### 2. Login Verification

If login status for X has been confirmed in the current session → skip this step.

Otherwise: open `https://x.com` and observe the left sidebar:
- User avatar or "@username" visible at the bottom → logged in, continue
- "Sign in" or "Log in" button visible → not logged in, inform user that X login is required and assist with the login flow

User refuses or cannot log in → terminate execution.

## Capability Components

> This Skill's operational boundary = what the user can manually do in their browser. It reads tweet data already rendered in the X DOM, never bypassing authentication. JS is encapsulated in `scripts/` files, invoked via `eval "$(python scripts/xxx.py)"`. Use the bash tool for execution.

### DOM: Tweet list extraction (React Fiber)

Extracts all currently visible tweets from the page via React internal state (React Fiber). Works on search pages, profile pages, list pages, and any X page rendering tweet articles.

Wait for tweets to appear before extracting:
```
wait --selector "article[data-testid='tweet']" --state attached --timeout 15000
```

Extract: `eval "$(python scripts/extract-tweets.py)"`

Returns a JSON array. Each element:

```json

## URL Construction Guide

### Input type → URL mapping

**searchTerms** (keyword / advanced query):
- Sort Latest: `https://x.com/search?q={url_encoded_query}&src=typed_query&f=live`
- Sort Top: `https://x.com/search?q={url_encoded_query}&src=typed_query`
- Sort Latest+Top: run both URLs in sequence, deduplicate by tweet ID

**twitterHandles** (scrape a user's profile tweets):
- Option A (profile page): `https://x.com/{handle}` — shows all tweets/retweets
- Option B (search): use `from:{handle}` as the search query — more filter-compatible

**startUrls** (direct URLs): navigate to the URL as-is. Supported types:
- Tweet URL: `https://x.com/{user}/status/{id}` — single tweet conversation
- Profile URL: `https://x.com/{handle}` — profile timeline
- Search URL: `https://x.com/search?q=...` — use directly
- List URL: `https://x.com/i/lists/{list_id}` — list timeline

### Filter parameters → query operators

Append these operators to the base query string (space-separated):

| Parameter | Query operator | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `tweetLanguage` | `lang:{code}` | `lang:en` |
| `onlyVerifiedUsers` | `filter:verified` | |
| `onlyTwitterBlue` | `filter:blue_verified` | |
| `onlyImage` | `filter:images` | |
| `onlyVideo` | `filter:videos` | |
| `onlyQuote` | `filter:quote` | |
| `author` | `from:{handle}` | `from:NASA` |
| `inReplyTo` | `to:{handle}` | `to:NASA` |
| `mentioning` | `@{handle}` | `@NASA` |
| `minimumRetweets` | `min_retweets:{n}` | `min_retweets:100` |
| `minimumFavorites` | `min_faves:{n}` | `min_faves:500` |
| `minimumReplies` | `min_replies:{n}` | `min_replies:10` |
| `start` | `since:{YYYY-MM-DD}` | `since:2024-01-01` |
| `end` | `until:{YYYY-MM-DD}` | `until:2024-06-01` |
| `geotaggedNear` + `withinRadius` | `near:"{location}" within:{radius}` | `near:"New York" within:15mi` |
| `geocode` | `geocode:{lat},{lon},{radius}` | `geocode:40.7,-74.0,10km` |
| `-filter:retweets` | exclude retweets | |

**Example**: Scrape English tweets from NASA since 2024 with ≥100 likes, excluding retweets:
```
query = "from:NASA lang:en since:2024-01-01 min_faves:100 -filter:retweets"
url = "https://x.com/search?q=" + encodeURIComponent(query) + "&src=typed_query&f=live"
```

## Pagination

**DOM Pagination** (scroll to load more):

X dynamically appends new tweet articles to the DOM as the user scrolls. Tweets already rendered remain in the DOM (no virtualization for typical result sets < ~500 tweets).

Loop pattern:
1. Record current tweet count: extract → note `len(results)`
2. `scroll down --amount 2000`
3. `wait stable`
4. Extract again → compare IDs, add new ones to collection
5. Termination conditions:
   - New extraction returns 0 new tweet IDs (end of results reached)
   - `collected >= max_items` (if limit specified)
   - Same tweet IDs returned 3 consecutive times (no more data loading)

Deduplication: track seen IDs in a Python set, filter before appending to output.

## Success Criteria

`result count >= 1` and `id field non-null rate = 100%` and `text field non-null rate = 100%`

## Known Limitations

- **React Fiber key**: The `__reactFiber` prefix includes a session-specific hash (e.g., `__reactFiber$ozawbbp0gp`). The script uses `startsWith('__reactFiber')` which is stable across deployments; only fails if React is replaced with a different framework.
- **DOM virtualization**: For very large result sets (500+ tweets), X may virtualize older DOM nodes to reclaim memory. If extraction suddenly returns fewer tweets than expected after extended scrolling, the remaining tweets may have been removed from DOM. Mitigation: save results incrementally after each scroll batch.
- **View count**: `view_count` is null for older tweets, low-engagement tweets, or when X doesn't expose it. This is a data availability issue, not an extraction failure.
- **List URL**: Requires a valid, accessible public list ID. Private lists return no tweets.
- **`filter:blue_verified`**: Whether X's search engine respects this operator may vary; verify results if blue-verified filtering is critical.
- **`customMapFunction`**: Not applicable — this is a source-platform-specific JS transform parameter, not a data filter relevant to browser extraction.
- **Rate limiting**: X may temporarily stop loading new tweets after aggressive scrolling. Add 1–2s delays between scroll batches for large collections.

## Execution Efficiency

- **Batch orchestration**: For multiple search queries or handles, process them serially in one browser session with short delays (1–2s) between navigations. Do not open parallel searches in the same browser — use separate sessions for parallel work.
- **Test before batch execution**: Test with 1 query first, verify 10+ tweets extract correctly, then run the full batch.
- **Reduce redundant pre-operations**: Login check only needed once per session; skip on subsequent queries.
- **Error resumption**: Save results to a file after each URL/query. On failure, resume from the last saved query rather than restarting from scratch.
- **Incremental save**: After each scroll batch, append new tweets to the output file rather than holding everything in memory.

## Experience Notes

Path: `{working-directory}/browser-act-skill-forge-memories/x-tweet-scraper-x-tweet-search.memory.md`

**Before execution**: If the file exists, read it first — it records unexpected situations encountered during past executions (e.g., a strategy has become ineffective); adjust strategy order accordingly.

**After execution**: If an unexpected situation is encountered (strategy became ineffective, page redesigned, anti-scraping upgraded, better path discovered), append a line:
`{YYYY-MM-DD}: {what happened} → {conclusion}`

Normal execution does not write to the file. Do not record what keywords were used or how many results were returned — those are task outputs, not experience.
