# Logo Concepts

> **Does:** generates clean, **editable SVG** logo directions you can refine and ship.
> **Solves:** paying for five logo rounds before seeing anything usable.
> **Triggers on:** *"give me logo concepts for [name]"*

## How Maxim does this

Routes to the `brand` + `ui-styling` + `banner-design` depth and emits **3–5 distinct SVG directions** (real vector code you can edit — not a flat raster). If a **Brand Kit** is set, concepts stay inside your locked colors/fonts; if not, it proposes a palette and says so.

## Behavioral overlay

- **Frameworks (cited per ADR-007):** **Gestalt principles** (closure, figure-ground) · **Color Psychology** · **Golden Ratio / visual balance** · **Pre-attentive attributes** (does it read at 16px?).
- **Confidence tag (ADR-010):** default **🟡 MEDIUM** — a logo is subjective; this gives you strong, editable *directions* to pursue, not a finished mark. Each concept names the idea it expresses so you choose on strategy, not taste.
- **No-fabrication:** it won't claim trademark-clearance or originality — that's your designer/lawyer's call, and it says so.

## Output

3–5 editable SVG concepts · the idea behind each · the one or two worth developing · usage notes (favicon / dark-bg legibility).
