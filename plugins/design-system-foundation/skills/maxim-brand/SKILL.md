- Executes: brand-guidelines.md → design-tokens.json → design-tokens.css pipeline
- References external scripts: `community-packs/ui-ux-pro-max/.claude/skills/brand/scripts/`
  - `inject-brand-context.cjs` — inject brand into prompts
  - `sync-brand-to-tokens.cjs` — sync brand → tokens

## Maxim Behavioral Framing

**Core Principle:** Brand is a cognitive shortcut (Kahneman System 1). Every brand element must:
1. Reduce cognitive load while building recognition
2. Trigger emotional resonance before rational evaluation
3. Create consistency that compounds into trust over time

**Framework Selection by Task:**

| Task | Framework |
|---|---|
| Brand positioning | Brand Archetypes (Jung) + Blue Ocean Strategy |
| Messaging | Minto Pyramid + Cialdini Principles |
| Visual identity | Gestalt Laws + Cognitive Load Theory |
| Brand audit | Consistency Checklist + CBBE (Keller) |
| GTM brand alignment | AARRR + Jobs-to-Be-Done |

## Dispatch

| Argument | Agent | External Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | brand-strategist + brand-voice-architect | `references/brand-guideline-template.md` |
| `update` | brand-sync-operator | `references/update.md` |
| `audit` | brand-guardian | `references/consistency-checklist.md` + `references/approval-checklist.md` |
| `voice` | brand-voice-architect | `references/voice-framework.md` + `references/messaging-framework.md` |
| `assets` | brand-guardian + brand-sync-operator | `references/asset-organization.md` + `references/color-palette-management.md` |

## Proactive Agent Loops

- **Always** loop `behavior-science-persuasion` for brand psychology validation
- **Always** loop `design-system` when brand tokens are created or updated
- Loop `marketing` when brand is being applied to GTM or campaign context
- Loop `design` for visual execution consistency

## Confidence Tagging

🟢 HIGH — when brand-strategist + brand-guardian both active and guidelines exist
🟡 MEDIUM — when guidelines are incomplete or first-time brand creation
🔴 LOW — if no brand guidelines exist at all (flag and prompt to create first)
