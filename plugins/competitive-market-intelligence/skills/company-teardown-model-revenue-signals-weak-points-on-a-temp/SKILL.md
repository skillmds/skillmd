# Company Teardown

> **Does:** breaks down a company's model, revenue signals, and weak points on a fixed template.
> **Solves:** half a day of scattered research per target.
> **Triggers on:** *"do a teardown of [company]"*

## How Maxim does this (one named skill over the CINO analyst)

Surfaces the `competitive-intel-analyst` as a one-shot, fixed-template teardown: **business model · how they make money (revenue signals) · positioning · pricing · moat (and its source) · weak points · the opening for you**. Same template every time, so teardowns are comparable across targets.

## Behavioral overlay

- **Frameworks (cited per ADR-007):** **Porter's Five Forces** · **7 Powers** (Helmer — what kind of moat) · **Wardley Mapping** (where they sit on the value chain) · **Business Model Canvas**.
- **No-fabrication is load-bearing here:** public/verifiable facts are stated as facts with the source; anything inferred is explicitly marked **inference**, not fact. Revenue figures for private companies are flagged as estimates. This is why the default tag is **🟡 MEDIUM** — a teardown mixes verified and inferred signal, and Maxim labels which is which (the discipline a generic "research this company" prompt skips).
- **Confidence tag (ADR-010)** per section, not just overall.

## Output

A fixed-template teardown: model · revenue signals · positioning · pricing · moat + source · weak points · your opening — every claim marked fact vs. inference.
