# Competitor Watch

> **Does:** tracks what a named competitor is shipping and pings you only on **real** moves.
> **Solves:** finding out about a competitor's launch a month late.
> **Triggers on:** *"watch [competitor] and tell me what changes"*

## How Maxim does this

Routes to `competitive-intel-analyst` + web sources, compares against the last snapshot, and reports **only real moves** since — launches, pricing changes, positioning shifts — not noise. Each move gets a *so-what* (does it threaten your moat?), grounded in Porter / 7 Powers.

## Behavioral overlay

- **Frameworks (cited per ADR-007):** **Porter's Five Forces** · **7 Powers** · **signal detection** (real move vs. PR noise).
- **No-fabrication is load-bearing:** verified moves are stated as fact with the source; anything inferred (e.g. "likely targeting enterprise") is marked **inference**. Default **🟡 MEDIUM** for that reason.

## The unattended "monitor" version

`orchestrator/workflows/competitor-watch.mjs` — the read-only Workflow #2 from the standard: scheduled, **dry-run-default**, idempotent (won't re-report the same move), bounded + logged. Read-only, so it never acts — it only surfaces. Go-live just turns on the morning delivery.

## Output

Moves since last check (launch / pricing / positioning) · significance vs. your moat · sources · *fact vs. inference* marked.
