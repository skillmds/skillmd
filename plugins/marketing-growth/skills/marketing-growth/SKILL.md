# Marketing & Growth -- Domain Dispatcher

> Office: CMO | Lead: content-strategist
> Sub-skills: 17 | Frameworks: AARRR Pirate Metrics, Growth Loops, AIDA, Cialdini, PAS, StoryBrand, Obviously Awesome, Hook Model, JTBD
> Hub file: MARKETING-CONTEXT.md (read by all sub-skills before executing)

## Purpose

The CMO's growth marketing domain -- covering campaign execution, GTM strategy, channel-specific social media strategy, and full-funnel growth. This skill orchestrates channel specialists (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, Reddit), growth experimentation, app store optimization, and content creation. Maxim applies behavioral science to every campaign output -- persuasion triggers, conversion psychology, and social proof frameworks -- ensuring marketing drives measurable behavior change.

## Activation

This domain activates when:
- User invokes `/mxm-cmo`
- Task contains keywords: marketing, campaign, growth, social media, GTM, brand awareness, conversion, growth hacking, user acquisition, funnel, retention, email marketing, landing page, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit
- Executive router detects marketing, growth, or campaign signals
- Other Maxim skills proactively loop here: behavior-science-persuasion (campaign psychology), search-visibility (SEO/AEO alignment), brand (brand consistency), content-creation (campaign content)

## Behavioral Layer

- Confidence: 🟢 HIGH (Maxim skill + external knowledge merged)
- Compliance: reads project-manifest.json before decisions
- Handoff: writes .mxm-skills/agents-handoff.md on completion
- Ethics gate: none -- standard Maxim behavioral output quality applies. Exception: `localization-specialist` outputs touching Bill 96 or language law auto-loop compliance skill (CSO auto-loop rule).
- Frameworks: AARRR Pirate Metrics (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral), Growth Loops, AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action), Cialdini's 6 Principles, Hook Model (engagement), Fogg Behavior Model (campaign triggers)

## External Sources

- Primary: community-packs/claude-skills-library/marketing-skill/ (growth frameworks, channel playbooks, campaign templates, GTM patterns)
- Conflict resolution: Maxim ALWAYS WINS

## Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

All marketing sub-skills read `MARKETING-CONTEXT.md` before executing. This foundation file contains the project's product definition, ICP, positioning, brand voice, pricing, active campaigns, and funnel stages. Fill it in per-project to ensure consistent, contextual marketing outputs across all 17 sub-skills.

### Shared Resources

- `shared-resources/funnel-frameworks.md` -- Quick reference of all funnel frameworks (AARRR, AIDA, Flywheel, Hook Model, RACE, STP, Bow-Tie)
- `shared-resources/pricing-models.md` -- Quick reference of pricing strategies (value-based, usage-based, freemium, tiered, per-seat, flat-rate)
