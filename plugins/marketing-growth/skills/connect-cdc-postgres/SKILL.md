  Streams change data capture from PostgreSQL into Redpanda or Kafka using Redpanda
  Connect's postgres_cdc input, which reads the WAL through logical replication
  (pgoutput). Use when configuring postgres_cdc (formerly pg_stream), setting up
  wal_level=logical, replication slots, and publications, enabling an initial
  snapshot before streaming, or troubleshooting slot growth and WAL accumulation.
  Also covers Redpanda Enterprise destination features such as Iceberg Topics,
  Tiered Storage, and server-side Schema ID Validation, since postgres_cdc itself
  requires a Redpanda Enterprise license.

# Redpanda Connect CDC: PostgreSQL

The `postgres_cdc` input in Redpanda Connect streams change data capture (CDC) from a PostgreSQL database into Redpanda or any Kafka-compatible topic. It uses PostgreSQL's logical replication protocol (`pgoutput` plugin), reads the Write-Ahead Log (WAL), and optionally snapshots all existing rows before switching to live replication. Introduced in version 4.39.0. The legacy name `pg_stream` is deprecated.

This is an **Enterprise feature** — a Redpanda Enterprise license is required. The connector creates and manages a logical replication slot and a publication automatically, but both can be pre-created manually.

## Quickstart

### 1. Prepare PostgreSQL (4 commands)

```sql
-- 1. Verify or set wal_level (requires server restart if changed)
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
-- Check current value:
SHOW wal_level;   -- must return 'logical'

-- 2. Create a dedicated replication user
CREATE USER cdc_user WITH REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD 'secret';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO cdc_user;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE public.orders, public.customers TO cdc_user;

-- 3. (Optional) Pre-create the publication to avoid needing CREATE PUBLICATION privilege
-- Connector uses the pattern: pglog_stream_<slot_name>
CREATE PUBLICATION pglog_stream_my_slot FOR TABLE public.orders, public.customers;

-- 4. (Optional) Pre-create the replication slot
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

### 2. Full pipeline YAML (snapshot + stream, two tables)

```yaml
# postgres-cdc-pipeline.yaml
input:
  label: "pg_cdc"
  postgres_cdc:
    dsn: postgres://cdc_user:secret@localhost:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable
    schema: public
    tables:
      - orders
      - customers
    slot_name: my_slot
    stream_snapshot: true        # back-fill existing rows first
    snapshot_batch_size: 5000   # rows per query during snapshot
    max_parallel_snapshot_tables: 2   # snapshot both tables simultaneously
    checkpoint_limit: 1024
    heartbeat_interval: 1h       # prevents slot lag on quiet tables
    include_transaction_markers: false
    batching:
      count: 100
      period: 1s

pipeline:
  processors:
    # Route each event to a topic named after the source table
    - mapping: |
        meta topic = "pg.cdc." + metadata("table")

output:
  kafka_franz:
    seed_brokers:
      - localhost:9092
    topic: ${! metadata("topic") }
    key: ${! json("id").string() }
```

> **Tip**: When writing to Redpanda, the native `redpanda` output is the idiomatic choice — it handles seed broker discovery and authentication more ergonomically than `kafka_franz`. `kafka_franz` is fully valid for both Redpanda and generic Kafka targets.

### 3. Run the pipeline

```bash
# Self-managed Redpanda Connect binary
redpanda-connect run postgres-cdc-pipeline.yaml

# Via rpk (if installed)
rpk connect run postgres-cdc-pipeline.yaml

# Docker
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/postgres-cdc-pipeline.yaml:/pipeline.yaml \
  docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/connect:latest \
  run /pipeline.yaml
```

### 4. Inspect the emitted messages

Every message has these metadata fields (set via `metadata()` in Bloblang):

| Metadata key | Value |
|---|---|
| `table` | Table name (unquoted), e.g. `orders` |
| `operation` | `read`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `begin`, `commit` |
| `lsn` | WAL log sequence number string; not set (absent) for snapshot `read` rows |
| `commit_ts_ms` | Transaction commit timestamp (Unix milliseconds); set on `insert`/`update`/`delete`. Not set for snapshot `read` rows (since 4.98.0) |
| `before` | Pre-change row state for `update` and `delete`, in Benthos common schema format. For updates the contents depend on the table's `REPLICA IDENTITY`: the default identity carries only key columns, `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` carries all columns (since 4.99.0) |
| `schema` | Column schema in Benthos common format; set on `read`, `insert`, `update`, `delete` messages. Use with `parquet_encode: { schema_metadata: schema }` |

Example payload for an `insert` into `orders`:

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "customer_id": 7,
  "amount": 99.99,
  "status": "pending"
}
```

## Snapshot Behavior

When `stream_snapshot: true` the connector:
1. Creates a temporary replication slot and exports a snapshot (`EXPORT_SNAPSHOT`)
2. Opens reader transactions pinned to that snapshot and scans each table in key-order batches
3. Emits messages with `operation: read` (no `lsn` — LSN is `nil` for snapshot rows)
4. After all tables are fully scanned, copies the temporary slot into the permanent `slot_name` slot
5. Drops the temporary slot and begins streaming WAL changes from the LSN at snapshot time

Tables being snapshot **must have a primary key** — the connector uses the primary key to parallelize and paginate the scan.

## Operational Notes

- **Replication slot growth**: An unacknowledged replication slot blocks WAL reclamation. If the pipeline stops for a long time, disk can fill. Monitor `pg_replication_slots.confirmed_flush_lsn` and `pg_current_wal_lsn() - confirmed_flush_lsn`.
- **Heartbeats**: For tables with infrequent writes, the connector will not have LSNs to acknowledge, causing WAL accumulation. `heartbeat_interval` (default `1h`) writes a logical message periodically via `pg_logical_emit_message` to keep the LSN moving. Set to `0s` to disable.
- **TOAST columns**: For `UPDATE`/`DELETE` where `REPLICA IDENTITY` is not `FULL`, unchanged TOAST columns are not included in the WAL. Set `unchanged_toast_value` to a sentinel string to distinguish "unchanged" from "null".
- **Restarts**: On restart the connector reads `pg_replication_slots.confirmed_flush_lsn` and resumes from that LSN. Snapshot is skipped if the slot already exists.
- **Slot name validation**: `slot_name` must match `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` — alphanumeric and underscores only.
- **Publication naming**: The connector auto-creates (and manages) a publication named `pglog_stream_<slot_name>`. Pre-create it with exactly that name to avoid needing `CREATE PUBLICATION` privilege.

## Control Signals (since 4.105.0)

Set `signal_table_name` to have the connector watch a dedicated **signal table** for control signals. Rows inserted into that table are both acted on as signals *and* forwarded downstream as ordinary CDC messages. This gives you an in-band, transactionally-ordered channel to send instructions to a running pipeline by writing a row to PostgreSQL.

The signal table must live in the schema set by `schema`, and it must **not** also appear in `tables` — the connector implicitly adds it to the publication and excludes it from snapshot scans, so listing it in both places is rejected at startup. It needs three columns (startup validation checks the column *names* only; a wrong column type is caught later, at runtime on the first signal row):

- `id` — any type representable as a string (`SERIAL`, `BIGSERIAL`, `UUID`, `VARCHAR`, …)
- `type` — a string type; the signal type (see below)
- `data` — `TEXT`; a JSON object carrying the signal's parameters

```sql
CREATE TABLE <schema>.<signal_table_name> (
    id   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(32),
    data TEXT
);
```

```yaml
input:
  postgres_cdc:
    dsn: postgres://cdc_user:secret@localhost:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable
    schema: public
    tables:
      - orders
    slot_name: my_slot
    signal_table_name: rpcn_signal_table
```

Signal rows are published like any other insert (`operation: insert`, `table: <signal_table_name>`). To keep them out of downstream processing, filter on the `table` metadata field:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        root = if @table == "rpcn_signal_table" { deleted() } else { this }
```

**Supported signal types** are recognized from the row's `type` column; an unrecognized type is forwarded downstream but only logged as a warning. The `log` signal is currently recognized — its `data` must be a JSON object with a `message` key, whose value is written to the connector's log output. The recognized set may grow across releases; confirm it against the generated `postgres_cdc` reference (or `rpk connect create postgres_cdc`) rather than assuming this list is exhaustive.

```sql
INSERT INTO <schema>.<signal_table_name> (type, data)
VALUES ('log', '{"message": "Signal message"}');
```

## Enterprise Features for CDC Sink Topics

`postgres_cdc` is itself a Redpanda Connect **Enterprise connector** (blocked after the 30-day trial without a license). Beyond the connector, the Redpanda topics that receive CDC events unlock additional **Enterprise** differentiators — each requires a valid license on the **cluster**:

- **Iceberg Topics**: land CDC events directly in an Apache Iceberg (v2) table in object storage — no separate ETL. Enable with cluster `iceberg_enabled=true` plus per-topic `redpanda.iceberg.mode` (`key_value`, `value_schema_id_prefix`, `value_schema_latest`, `disabled`), and tune `redpanda.iceberg.target.lag.ms`, `redpanda.iceberg.partition.spec`, `redpanda.iceberg.delete`, `redpanda.iceberg.invalid.record.action` (`drop`/`dlq_table`). Tiered Storage is a prerequisite.
- **Tiered Storage**: retain CDC topics long-term in object storage with `redpanda.remote.write`/`redpanda.remote.read` (cluster master switch `cloud_storage_enabled`) and `retention.local.target.ms`/`.bytes`.
- **Server-Side Schema ID Validation**: reject CDC events with unregistered schema IDs via cluster `enable_schema_id_validation` (`none`/`redpanda`/`compat`) and per-topic `redpanda.value.schema.id.validation` + `redpanda.value.subject.name.strategy` (applies when events are serialized in the Schema Registry wire format).
- **Connect secrets management**: resolve the DSN password / AWS keys from an external secret manager at runtime instead of embedding them.
