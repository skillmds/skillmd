# Multi-Engine

Claw Orchestrator supports multiple coding CLI engines behind a unified `ISession` interface. Each engine manages its own subprocess, event stream, and cost tracking independently.

## Supported Engines

### Claude Code (`engine: 'claude'`)

Default engine. Long-running subprocess with streaming JSON I/O. Tested with Claude Code CLI **2.1.207**.

- Persistent multi-turn conversations
- Real-time streaming (text, tool_use, tool_result, system events)
- Session resume via `--resume`
- Full cost tracking from API usage data
- Cross-session peer messaging (`crossSessionInbound`): sets this session's policy for messages sent from other Claude Code sessions on the same machine — `accept` delivers straight in, `hold` waits for a human to approve it in that session's terminal, `refuse` rejects it. There is no CLI flag for this; it is a settings key, delivered through the `--settings` merge. Worth setting explicitly for orchestrated sessions: with no value the CLI decides from the two sides' permission modes and holds when they differ, and an orchestrated session (`bypassPermissions` / `acceptEdits`) versus a human terminal (prompting) is exactly that case — so the message parks waiting for approval in a terminal nobody is watching. Sessions started by the orchestrator do register as addressable peers and do receive messages (verified against 2.1.232 by sending to a live one and getting a reply). Note that a user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` value may take precedence over the per-session one; only the `accept` path has been confirmed end-to-end here.
- Hook lifecycle events (`includeHookEvents`), subagent output forwarding (`forwardSubagentText`), permission delegation (`permissionPromptTool`), prompt cache optimization (`bare` + `excludeDynamicSystemPromptSections` + `enablePromptCaching1H`), debug control, `--from-pr` resume, and MCP channel subscriptions
- Fork subagent (`forkSubagent`), tool search (`enableToolSearch`), OpenTelemetry logging toggles (`otelLogUserPrompts`, `otelLogRawApiBodies`), `xhigh` effort tier (Opus 4.7), and `stats.pluginErrors` capture — see [CLI 2.1.121 options in SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) and [tools.md](./tools.md)

> **Behavior changes from upstream Claude CLI 2.1.121** (worth knowing if you set permission rules):
> - `--agent` / `--print` now enforce agent frontmatter `permissionMode`, `tools`, `disallowedTools` (was advisory). Affects `council` agent personas.
> - `Bash(find:*)` permission rule no longer auto-approves `find -exec` or `find -delete`. Add explicit rules if you depend on these.
> - `--dangerously-skip-permissions` also skips prompts for `.claude/skills/` directory. Treat with care.
> - Distributed tracing context (`TRACEPARENT` / `TRACESTATE`) is automatically forwarded to the child process — set them in the parent before starting the session.

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'claude-task',
  engine: 'claude',       // default, can omit
  model: 'opus',
  cwd: '/project',
});
```

### OpenAI Codex (`engine: 'codex'`)

Wraps the `codex exec` subcommand. Each `send()` spawns a new process. Tested with `codex` CLI **0.147.0**.

- Non-interactive execution via `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --json` (replaces the deprecated `--full-auto` flag from earlier Codex versions)
- Real `usage` from the `turn.completed` JSON event (input, output, cached, reasoning tokens). **These are cumulative over the thread, not per turn** — three identical turns on 0.147.0 report `input_tokens` 13,856 → 27,727 → 41,613, each matching `total_token_usage` in that thread's rollout exactly. They are assigned to the session totals, never added; subtracting consecutive values recovers the turn's own prompt
- `contextPercent` is that per-turn prompt (which, for a thread-resuming engine, is the live context occupancy) over **codex's own limit**, harvested from the thread's rollout file (`model_context_window`, 258,400 on 0.147.0). The model registry holds the published window — 1,050,000 for gpt-5.x — which codex does not honour, so measuring against it reads ~4x low. Resuming a thread also seeds the token baseline from the rollout, so the first send does not mistake the whole thread history for one prompt. All of this is best-effort: an unreadable or `--ephemeral` thread falls back to the registry window
- `item.completed` parsing distinguishes `reasoning` / `todo_list` (logged, not counted) from real tool items (`command_execution`, `file_change`, `mcp_tool_call`, `web_search`, which increment `toolCalls`; a non-zero `command_execution.exit_code` increments `toolErrors`)
- Reasoning effort: the engine-agnostic `effort` maps to `-c model_reasoning_effort=<level>` (`max`→`xhigh`; `auto`/`ultracode` omitted)
- `codexProfile` → `--profile <name>` (named config profile from `~/.codex/config.toml`)
- Per-session continuity: the `thread_id` from the first turn's `thread.started` event is captured and reused via `codex exec resume <id>` for subsequent sends, so the model sees prior turns
- `sandboxMode` maps to `--sandbox <mode>` on the first turn. **A resumed thread does not inherit it**, and `codex exec resume` rejects `--sandbox`, so the policy is restated as `-c sandbox_mode="<mode>"` on every resume. Without that, a `read-only` session goes writable from its second turn onward — verified against 0.146.0, where such a session wrote to disk on turn 2 on every attempt. Re-probed on 0.147.0 (direct write, shell redirect and delegate-to-subagent, each on a resumed turn): no writes
- One-shot execution per message (no persistent subprocess between sends)
- Captures the real Codex thread ID and persists it, so later sends and process-level session resume use `codex exec resume <thread_id>`
- Working directory passed via `-C` flag
- Default model: `gpt-5.5`
- Requires `codex` CLI >= 0.119 (for `exec resume`): `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- **Does not support `/goal`** — for that, use `engine: 'codex-app'` below

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'codex-task',
  engine: 'codex',
  model: 'gpt-5.5',
  cwd: '/project',
  sandboxMode: 'workspace-write', // optional, this is the default
});
```

### OpenAI Codex App-Server (`engine: 'codex-app'`)

Wraps `codex app-server --listen stdio:// --enable goals` as a long-running JSON-RPC subprocess. **Required for `/goal` long-horizon objective support** — Codex's exec subcommand has no slash-command surface.

- Long-running subprocess; one `codex app-server` per session
- JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio with v2 protocol method names (`initialize`, `thread/start`, `turn/start`, ...)
- Real-time streaming via `item/agentMessage/delta` notifications
- Cumulative token tracking from `thread/tokenUsage/updated` notifications. The same notification's `last` breakdown and `modelContextWindow` drive `contextPercent`, so it reports live occupancy against the window the server actually enforces (258,400 on 0.147.0) rather than a running total over the model's published window
- Goal lifecycle observation via `thread/goal/updated` and `thread/goal/cleared` notifications
- Goal control via the `codex_goal_*` tools (which internally send the `/goal` slash command as user text — see [tools.md](./tools.md#codex-13))
- v2 RPC tools (Codex 0.137): `codex_interrupt` (`turn/interrupt`), `codex_steer` (`turn/steer`), `codex_fork` (`thread/fork`), `codex_rollback` (`thread/rollback`), `codex_models` (`model/list`), `codex_threads` (`thread/list`). A `turn/completed` with `status: 'failed'` rejects the turn and increments `toolErrors`.
- Thread resume: starting with `resumeSessionId` loads the existing thread via `thread/resume` instead of `thread/start`.

> **Feature-flag risk.** The `goals` feature is marked "under development" in Codex 0.128.0 and has known bugs (e.g. issue #20591). The session class always passes `--enable goals` so it works the moment upstream stabilizes the feature, but during the transition period some goal commands may fail or be silently dropped on the server side. The wrapper layer is unaffected.

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'codex-goal-task',
  engine: 'codex-app',
  model: 'gpt-5.5',
  cwd: '/project',
});
// Then either:
//   await manager.codexGoalCommand('codex-goal-task', 'build a tic-tac-toe app');
// or via the codex_goal_set tool:
//   await tool('codex_goal_set', { name: 'codex-goal-task', objective: 'build a tic-tac-toe app' });
```

### Google Antigravity (`engine: 'agy'`)

Wraps Google's **Antigravity CLI** (`agy`) — the successor to Gemini CLI (consumer
Gemini CLI tiers stopped serving 2026-06-18). Each `send()` spawns a new process
in print mode. Verified against `agy` **1.1.1**.

- One-shot execution per message (no persistent subprocess)
- **Plain-text output** — agy has no structured/stream-json mode, so stdout is
  forwarded as streaming text and **token counts are estimated** (~4 chars/token)
- **Real conversation continuity**: agy logs `Created conversation <uuid>` to its
  log file; the engine passes a private `--log-file`, harvests the ID after the
  first turn, and resumes with `--conversation <id>` on subsequent sends. Seed it
  externally via `resumeSessionId` (bare UUID only); read it back from
  `getStats().agyConversationId`
- Permission modes: `bypassPermissions` → `--dangerously-skip-permissions`,
  `default` → `--sandbox` (terminal-restricted), and
  `sandboxMode: 'read-only'` → `--mode plan` (takes precedence). Other modes
  run agy's own approval flow, which blocks in headless print mode — use
  `bypassPermissions` for autonomous write-enabled work
- agy enforces its own print timeout (default 5m); the engine derives
  `--print-timeout` from the send timeout so the wrapper timer decides
- Unknown `--model` slugs do **not** error — agy silently falls back to its
  default model. Registered slugs: `gemini-3.5-flash` (alias `agy-flash`),
  `gemini-3.1-pro` (alias `agy-pro`); agy also proxies Claude and GPT-OSS
  models (`agy models` lists them) which pass through unregistered. The
  `agy/` prefix forces Antigravity routing for provider-like model strings
- Consumer auth is a one-time `agy` Google OAuth login (subscription quotas, no
  per-token billing — registry pricing mirrors Gemini API rates as a value proxy)
- Requires `agy` installed: `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash`
- Binary: `agy` (set `AGY_BIN` env var to override)

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'antigravity-task',
  engine: 'agy',
  model: 'gemini-3.5-flash',
  cwd: '/project',
});
```

> **Legacy: `engine: 'gemini'`.** Google sunset the consumer Gemini CLI (tiers stopped
> serving 2026-06-18) in favour of Antigravity. The `gemini` engine still exists and
> still works — existing callers are not broken, and `gemini-*` model strings outside
> agy's registered slugs still route to it — but it is no longer a documented option,
> is not version-tracked, and gets no new work. Use `agy` for Google. (Unrelated: the
> multi-model **proxy** still talks to the Gemini **API**; that is a different
> subsystem and is unaffected.)

### Cursor Agent (`engine: 'cursor'`)

Wraps the Cursor Agent CLI (`agent`) with `--print --output-format stream-json`. Write-enabled sessions use `--force`. Each `send()` spawns a new process.

- Conversation continuity: the chat id from the first turn's `system` event is captured and passed back as `--resume <chatId>` on later sends, so the model sees prior turns. `--continue` is deliberately not used: it resumes "the latest chat", which collides between concurrent sessions.
- One-shot execution per message (no persistent subprocess)
- Working directory via `--workspace` flag
- Real token counts from stream-json `result` events (camelCase: `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`)
- `--force` enables auto-approval of file changes. `sandboxMode: 'read-only'` does **not** use `--force`; it enforces read-only via a binding `.cursor/cli.json` deny config (`Write`/`Edit`/`Shell` denied) written into an isolated temp dir used as the process cwd, with `--workspace` pointing at the real project (the repo tree is never modified). `--mode plan` is passed too as model steering, but the deny config is the actual boundary — plan mode alone is model-cooperative and was verified to let an adversarial prompt write. Do not add `--sandbox` (it does not restrict in-workspace writes and overrides the mode). Read/grep/search remain available
- `--trust` auto-trusts the workspace without prompting
- Cursor uses its own model routing (e.g., `sonnet-4`, `gpt-5`, `auto`)
- Requires Cursor Agent CLI: `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsSL | bash`
- Binary: `agent` (set `CURSOR_BIN` env var to override)

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'cursor-task',
  engine: 'cursor',
  model: 'sonnet-4',
  cwd: '/project',
});
```

### OpenCode (`engine: 'opencode'`)

Wraps the [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) CLI with `run --format json`. Each `send()` spawns a new process.

- Conversation continuity: the session id from the event envelope is captured and passed back as `--session <id>` on later sends, so the model sees prior turns. `--continue` is deliberately not used: it means "the last session on this machine", which collides between concurrent sessions.
- One-shot execution per message (no persistent subprocess)
- NDJSON event stream with envelope `{ type, timestamp, sessionID, ... }`
- Event types: `text`, `reasoning`, `tool_use`, `step_start`, `step_finish`, `error`
- `text` and `tool_use` are **cumulative snapshots** keyed by `part.id` / `part.callID`; the wrapper diffs them to produce streaming deltas for `onText` callbacks and counts each tool invocation once
- Real token counts from `step_finish.part.tokens.{input,output,cache.read}`
- The wrapper closes the subprocess's stdin immediately after spawn (opencode otherwise reads stdin and blocks on EOF, hanging the call)
- Provider-agnostic: opencode's `--model` expects `provider/model` form (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). The wrapper passes `--model` through only when the value contains a `/`; otherwise opencode's own default applies
- `sandboxMode: 'read-only'` spawns a generated `clawo-readonly` agent (`--agent clawo-readonly` plus an `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` env var defining it) that denies `edit` / `bash` / `external_directory` / `webfetch` / **`task`** at the permission level and additionally removes those tools outright via the agent's `tools` map. It deliberately does **not** use OpenCode's built-in `plan` agent: that is a user-overridable preset whose compiled rules start with `{"permission":"*","action":"allow"}` and deny neither `bash` nor `edit`, so a "read-only" session could still author files through a shell heredoc. **`task` is the load-bearing denial**: denying only the write tools leaves the delegation path open, and the agent will hand the write to a subagent that runs under the default writable agent — asked to delegate, a session denied only `edit`/`bash`/`external_directory` wrote to disk on every attempt. Verify this config only with adversarial writes, and include prompts that ask the agent to delegate; `opencode agent list` renders compiled permission rules that look identical for a safe and an unsafe agent, and a probe that only asks for a direct write passes even when the delegation path is wide open
- Requires opencode installed: `brew install sst/tap/opencode` or `npm install -g opencode-ai`. Auth via `opencode auth login` **or** any provider env var (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, etc.) — opencode picks up either path
- Binary: `opencode` (set `OPENCODE_BIN` env var to override)

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'opencode-task',
  engine: 'opencode',
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4',
  cwd: '/project',
});
```

> **Schema stability:** opencode releases nearly daily and the JSON event schema is not formally documented. The parser tolerates unknown event types and missing fields — but pin a tested `opencode` version in CI if you depend on field names.

## ISession Interface

All engines implement `ISession`, making them interchangeable at the `SessionManager` level:

```typescript
interface ISession {
  // State
  sessionId?: string;
  readonly isReady: boolean;
  readonly isPaused: boolean;
  readonly isBusy: boolean;

  // Lifecycle
  start(): Promise<this>;
  stop(): void;
  pause(): void;
  resume(): void;

  // Communication
  send(message, options?): Promise<TurnResult | { requestId; sent }>;

  // Observability
  getStats(): SessionStats & { sessionId?; uptime };
  getHistory(limit?): Array<{ time; type; event }>;
  getCost(): CostBreakdown;

  // Context
  compact(summary?): Promise<TurnResult | { requestId; sent }>;
  getEffort(): EffortLevel;
  setEffort(level): void;

  // Model
  resolveModel(alias): string;

  // Events (EventEmitter)
  on(event, listener): this;
  emit(event, ...args): boolean;
}
```

## Team Tools Across Engines

Team tools (`team_list`, `team_send`) operate on the same virtual-team layer for **every** engine: the "team" is the set of all active sessions managed by SessionManager.

| Engine | `team_list` | `team_send` |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Claude | Lists other active SessionManager sessions | Routes via cross-session inbox |
| Codex | Lists other active SessionManager sessions | Routes via cross-session inbox |
| Antigravity | Lists other active SessionManager sessions | Routes via cross-session inbox |
| Cursor | Lists other active SessionManager sessions | Routes via cross-session inbox |

Messages are delivered via the inbox system — idle sessions receive immediately, busy sessions queue for later delivery.

> **Note:** Claude Code does have a native experimental "Agent Teams" feature (v2.1.32+, `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`), but it is an in-process TUI mechanism with no slash command or stdin-driven messaging — a subprocess wrapper cannot access its mailbox. Plugin team tools therefore use the engine-agnostic virtual team across the board.

## Proxy: Any Model via OpenClaw Gateway

Claude Code CLI only speaks Anthropic protocol. The built-in proxy translates Anthropic ↔ OpenAI format, letting you drive Claude Code with **any model** routed through the OpenClaw gateway.

### Zero Config

If OpenClaw gateway is running, everything is automatic:

```typescript
// No baseUrl, no env vars, no extra config
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'task',
  engine: 'claude',
  model: 'openclaw',        // gateway routes to your configured model
  cwd: '/project',
});
```

What happens behind the scenes:
1. Plugin reads `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` for gateway port + auth
2. Starts a local proxy server (random port, auto-managed)
3. Claude Code CLI sends Anthropic-format requests → proxy converts to OpenAI → gateway → any model

### Manual Config (optional)

Override with environment variables if needed:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GATEWAY_URL` | Auto-detected from openclaw.json | Gateway endpoint (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1`) |
| `GATEWAY_KEY` | Auto-detected from openclaw.json | Gateway auth password/token |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | - | Direct Gemini API access (bypasses gateway) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | - | Direct OpenAI API access (bypasses gateway) |

### Architecture

```
Claude Code CLI (Anthropic format)
  → Auto-proxy (Anthropic → OpenAI conversion)
    → OpenClaw Gateway (/v1/chat/completions, model="openclaw")
      → Any model (Gemini, GPT, local, etc.)
```

## Custom Engine (`engine: 'custom'`)

Integrate **any** coding agent CLI without writing engine-specific code. You provide a `CustomEngineConfig` that maps your CLI's flags to OpenClaw session concepts.

Two protocol modes:
- **Persistent** (`persistent: true`) — long-running subprocess with stream-json I/O over stdin/stdout (like Claude Code)
- **One-shot** (`persistent: false`, default) — new process spawned per `send()` (like Codex/Antigravity)

### CustomEngineConfig

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Display name (used in logs, session IDs) |
| `bin` | string | yes | Binary path or command name |
| `binEnv` | string | | Env var name that overrides `bin` at runtime |
| `persistent` | boolean | | `true` = persistent subprocess, `false` = one-shot (default) |
| `args` | object | yes | CLI flag mappings (see below) |
| `permissionModes` | object | | Maps OpenClaw mode names to CLI-specific values |
| `pricing` | object | | `{ input, output, cached? }` per 1M tokens |
| `contextWindow` | number | | Context window size (default: 200,000) |
| `env` | object | | Extra environment variables for the CLI process |
| `sanitizePatterns` | string[] | | Regex patterns to redact from stderr |

### args field

| Key | Example | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `print` | `"-p"` | Non-interactive/print mode flag |
| `outputFormat` | `"--output-format"` | Output format flag |
| `outputFormatValue` | `"stream-json"` | Value for stream-json output |
| `inputFormat` | `"--input-format"` | Input format flag (persistent only) |
| `inputFormatValue` | `"stream-json"` | Value for stream-json input |
| `skipPermissions` | `"-y"` | Skip all permissions flag |
| `permissionMode` | `"--permission-mode"` | Permission mode flag |
| `model` | `"--model"` | Model selection flag |
| `systemPrompt` | `"--system-prompt"` | System prompt override flag |
| `appendSystemPrompt` | `"--append-system-prompt"` | Append system prompt flag |
| `maxTurns` | `"--max-turns"` | Max agent turns flag |
| `resume` | `"--resume"` | Session resume flag (persistent only) |
| `verbose` | `"--verbose"` | Verbose output flag |
| `replayUserMessages` | `"--replay-user-messages"` | Replay user messages (persistent only) |
| `includePartialMessages` | `"--include-partial-messages"` | Include partial messages (persistent only) |
| `effort` | `"--effort"` | Effort level flag |
| `workspace` | `"--workspace"` | Workspace/cwd flag (one-shot only) |
| `extra` | `["--trust"]` | Additional static arguments |

### Example: Persistent mode (Claude Code-compatible CLI)

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'my-agent-task',
  engine: 'custom',
  cwd: '/project',
  customEngine: {
    name: 'my-agent',
    bin: 'my-agent',
    binEnv: 'MY_AGENT_BIN',
    persistent: true,
    args: {
      print: '-p',
      outputFormat: '--output-format',
      outputFormatValue: 'stream-json',
      inputFormat: '--input-format',
      inputFormatValue: 'stream-json',
      skipPermissions: '-y',
      permissionMode: '--permission-mode',
      model: '--model',
      systemPrompt: '--system-prompt',
      appendSystemPrompt: '--append-system-prompt',
      maxTurns: '--max-turns',
      resume: '--resume',
      verbose: '--verbose',
      replayUserMessages: '--replay-user-messages',
      includePartialMessages: '--include-partial-messages',
    },
    pricing: { input: 3, output: 15, cached: 0.3 },
    contextWindow: 200_000,
    sanitizePatterns: ['MY_API_KEY=[^\\s]+'],
  },
});
```

### Example: One-shot mode (simple CLI)

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'simple-agent-task',
  engine: 'custom',
  cwd: '/project',
  customEngine: {
    name: 'simple-agent',
    bin: '/usr/local/bin/simple-agent',
    persistent: false,  // default
    args: {
      print: '-p',
      outputFormat: '--output-format',
      outputFormatValue: 'stream-json',
      skipPermissions: '--yolo',
      model: '--model',
      workspace: '--workspace',
      extra: ['--no-color'],
    },
    permissionModes: {
      bypassPermissions: 'yolo',
      default: 'sandbox',
    },
    pricing: { input: 1, output: 5 },
  },
});
```

### Example: Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`)

> **Note:** `agy` now has first-class support — use [`engine: 'agy'`](#google-antigravity-engine-agy)
> instead, which adds conversation resume and timeout coherence the recipe below
> lacks. This recipe remains as a reference for driving older agy builds or
> forks with a diverged flag surface:

```typescript
await manager.startSession({
  name: 'antigravity-task',
  engine: 'custom',
  cwd: '/project',
  dangerouslySkipPermissions: true,
  customEngine: {
    name: 'antigravity',
    bin: 'agy',           // install: curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash
    binEnv: 'AGY_BIN',
    persistent: false,
    args: {
      print: '-p',                                  // single-prompt headless mode
      skipPermissions: '--dangerously-skip-permissions',
      workspace: '--add-dir',
      // NOTE: agy 1.0.2 has NO --output-format flag — output is plain text only.
      // Omitting outputFormat makes the wrapper parse plain text and *estimate*
      // tokens (no real usage / tool-call events). Watch for a JSON output mode.
    },
  },
});
```

Caveats with `agy` 1.0.2: (1) no structured/stream-json output → token counts are
estimated, not real; (2) requires a one-time `agy` Google OAuth login; (3) resume
by conversation ID isn't wired (no JSON stream to capture the ID from).

### Custom Engine in Council

Custom engines work in council by setting `engine: 'custom'` and `customEngine` on the agent persona:

```typescript
manager.councilStart('Build feature X', {
  agents: [
    {
      name: 'Planner',
      emoji: '🟠',
      persona: 'Architecture expert',
      engine: 'custom',
      customEngine: { name: 'my-agent', bin: 'my-agent', persistent: true, args: { ... } },
    },
    { name: 'Reviewer', emoji: '🔵', persona: 'Code reviewer', engine: 'claude', model: 'opus' },
  ],
  maxRounds: 10,
  projectDir: '/project',
});
```

## Adding a New Built-in Engine

To add a built-in engine (for CLIs that need custom protocol handling beyond what `CustomEngineConfig` supports):

1. Create `src/persistent-<engine>-session.ts` implementing `ISession`
2. Add the engine name to `EngineType` in `src/types.ts`
3. Add a case to `SessionManager._createSession()`
4. Add model pricing to `MODELS[]` in `src/models.ts`

The `ISession` interface is deliberately minimal — each engine handles its own subprocess bootstrapping, I/O protocol, and cleanup internally.

For most third-party CLIs, the `custom` engine with `CustomEngineConfig` is sufficient and requires zero code changes.
