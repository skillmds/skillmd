# Autoloop — Reference

Three-agent autonomous iteration loop for a git workspace. You converse with
the **Planner** to design a plan; on your approval, the Planner spawns the
**Coder** + **Reviewer** subloop, monitors it, and pushes you (wechat →
whatsapp → email fallback chain) only when something needs your attention.

This page is the operator reference.

## When to use

- Goal is exploratory and you want to **design the plan with the agent**
  before running. The Planner will read your workspace, surface ambiguity,
  and write `plan.md` / `goal.json` with you.
- You want a long-running loop you can walk away from. The Planner pushes
  you on regressions, completion, decisions, or stalls; otherwise it stays
  silent.
- You can write down what "better" means as a shell command (test pass
  count, latency, loss, gate completion). Without that anchor, Reviewer has
  nothing to ratchet on.

## Roles

| Agent | Default | cwd | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Planner** | claude / opus | workspace | strategy, `plan.md`, `goal.json`, talking to you |
| **Coder** | claude / sonnet | workspace | code changes, eval execution |
| **Reviewer** | claude / sonnet | `<workspace>/tasks/<run_id>/reviewer_sandbox/` | distrust audit; advance / hold / rollback |

Each role can use any built-in engine, or a `custom` engine config supplied by a
local caller (custom engines name an executable, so the HTTP API does not accept
them — see [tools.md](./tools.md)). If a non-Claude role omits `model`, that CLI
uses its own default model rather than receiving the Claude `opus` / `sonnet`
defaults. Role instructions are included in-band for engines that do not expose a
native system-prompt flag.

Engines without native multi-turn conversation (Cursor, OpenCode, one-shot custom
engines) spawn a fresh process per send, so the dispatcher replays that role's
transcript in-band as a `<conversation_history>` block, oldest turns dropped past a
character budget. Claude, Codex and Antigravity keep context themselves and get no
replay.

The Planner runs read-only so strategy cannot turn into source edits, and that is
enforced by the engine rather than requested politely: Claude uses plan mode,
Antigravity and Cursor use their plan modes, and OpenCode gets a generated
`clawo-readonly` agent that denies `edit`/`bash`/`external_directory` (its built-in
`plan` agent is a user-overridable preset that denies neither, so a "read-only"
session could otherwise still author files through a shell heredoc). A custom
Planner receives `permissionMode: 'manual'` and its `CustomEngineConfig` **must**
map that mode to the CLI's read-only flag — if it cannot, the session refuses to
start rather than silently running write-enabled.

Coder and Reviewer engine/model choices can be overridden by the first successful
`spawn_subagents`; later attempts to change an already-started role are rejected
instead of silently diverging from the running session.

Coder and Reviewer **never speak to you directly**. Anything they observe
flows through the Planner. The Planner decides what to surface and what to
absorb.

## UX flow

```
1. autoloop_start { run_id, workspace }       → Planner session ready
2. autoloop_chat { run_id, "<your goal>" }    → Planner reads workspace,
                                                drafts plan.md + goal.json,
                                                asks "ready to spawn?"
3. autoloop_chat { run_id, "go" }             → Planner emits spawn_subagents
4. Coder + Reviewer self-iterate              → ledger writes per iter
5. Planner pushes you on target_hit / regression / decision / stall
6. Run terminates on target hit, plan-defined max_iters, or your terminate.
```

## Plugin tools

| Tool | Args | What |
|---|---|---|
| `autoloop_start` | `run_id`, `workspace`, per-role `*_engine?`, `*_model?`, `*_custom_engine?`, `send_timeout_ms?` | Start a run; launches Planner and stores Coder/Reviewer defaults. Each `custom` role requires its matching config. |
| `autoloop_chat` | `run_id`, `text` | Send a chat message to the Planner; returns the Planner's reply. |
| `autoloop_status` | `run_id` | Current state (status, iter, push count, subagents_spawned). |
| `autoloop_list` | — | All active runs in this manager process. |
| `autoloop_stop` | `run_id`, `reason?` | Terminate; stops Planner / Coder / Reviewer. |
| `autoloop_reset_agent` | `run_id`, `agent` ('planner' / 'coder' / 'reviewer'), `force?`, `eager_restart?` | Reset one subagent. Planner reset requires `force: true`. |

## Planner-emitted control tools

The Planner controls the run by emitting fenced ` ```autoloop ` JSON blocks
inside its replies. The dispatcher parses them out and applies them. You
never see the JSON — only the Planner's narrative.

| Tool | Args | What |
|---|---|---|
| `notify_user` | `level` ('info' / 'warn' / 'decision' / 'error'), `summary`, `detail?`, `channel?` ('auto' / 'wechat' / 'webchat' / 'both' / 'email') | Push you out-of-band. |
| `spawn_subagents` | `coder_engine?`, `coder_model?`, `reviewer_engine?`, `reviewer_model?`, `initial_directive?` | Start Coder + Reviewer. Omitted values inherit run defaults. An engine change without a model uses the new engine's default. Once a role session has started, changing its engine/model is rejected. Custom configs cannot be emitted by Planner. Only after explicit user approval. |
| `send_directive` | `goal`, `constraints?`, `success_criteria?`, `max_attempts?` | Next iter's instruction to Coder. |
| `pause_loop` | `reason` | Halt subloop at next iter boundary; chat keeps working. |
| `resume_loop` | — | Resume after pause. |
| `terminate` | `reason` | End run. |
| `update_push_policy` | partial PushPolicy | Mutate notification rules (e.g. when you say "tell me every iter"). |
| `write_plan` | `content` (full plan.md body), `commit_message?` | Write `plan.md` to the workspace and git-commit. The **only** way the Planner can author plan.md — Write/Edit are stripped from the Planner session as a hard role boundary. Re-running replaces the whole file. |
| `write_goal` | `content` (full goal.json body), `commit_message?` | Same, for `goal.json`. Content is JSON-validated before write; malformed content errors back to the Planner. |

### Custom engines and resume

Custom engine configs are accepted only by `autoloop_start` (or the HTTP resume
body), never through Planner output. This keeps config fields such as `env` and
static CLI arguments out of the Planner transcript and `decisions.jsonl`.
The central registry persists only each role's engine and model, including the
effective Coder/Reviewer selection after a successful spawn. Resume leaves the
prior append-only row untouched until startup succeeds, so a transient CLI
failure cannot erase the run. When resuming a run that uses `custom`, provide
the matching `planner_custom_engine`, `coder_custom_engine`, or
`reviewer_custom_engine` again; otherwise resume fails with a clear
configuration error rather than silently switching to Claude. Custom config
shape is validated at runtime, while its `env` and static CLI arguments remain
out of registry and audit records. See [`multi-engine.md`](./multi-engine.md)
for the `CustomEngineConfig` shape.

## Default push policy

| Event | Default |
|---|---|
| on_start | info / wechat ("loop started, will notify on issues") |
| on_iter_done_ok | silent |
| on_target_hit | info / both (webchat + wechat) |
| on_metric_regression_2 | warn / both |
| on_reviewer_reject_2 | warn / both |
| on_phase_error | error / both |
| on_stall_30min | warn / wechat |
| on_decision_needed | decision / both |

5-minute dedup on (level, summary) prevents duplicate pushes from the same
event. Channel chain: `auto` walks wechat → whatsapp → email; `wechat` /
`webchat` / `email` route directly; `both` does webchat (if session known)
+ wechat fallback chain. **`on_phase_error` and `on_decision_needed` cannot
be set to `silent: true`** by Planner — `update_push_policy` strips the flag
and records the attempt in `decisions.jsonl` (these channels are the
operator's lifeline; they stay loud).

## Auto-compact

Each agent's context is monitored after every turn. When `getStats().contextPercent`
crosses the per-agent threshold the dispatcher invokes `/compact` with a
role-tuned hint (`compactSummaryFor`). Defaults: Planner 80 %, Coder 70 %,
Reviewer 70 %. Override per run via `compactThresholds`. A 30 s debounce
prevents re-fire while post-compact stats settle. Events: `compact` is
emitted on the dispatcher EventEmitter AND appended to `decisions.jsonl`.

One-shot engines (`codex`, `agy`, `cursor`, `opencode`) cannot compact — their
CLIs expose no such command. The threshold is still meaningful there because
`contextPercent` now tracks real occupancy, but crossing it cannot free space:
the session emits a single warning on its log channel the first time compaction
is requested, then the thread keeps growing until the CLI refuses the request.
Treat that warning as the signal to start a fresh session.

## Phase-error circuit

Subprocess deaths (Claude session lost), failed `git commit` in an iter, and
other phase-bound failures surface as `phase_error` messages instead of
silently masquerading as a "clarification request". The runner counts
consecutive `phase_error`s and:

1. Fires `on_phase_error` on each one (defaults to error / both channels).
2. After `phaseErrorCircuit` consecutive errors (default **3**) emits a
   `decision`-level push and an automatic `terminate { reason:
   'phase_error_circuit' }`.

A successful (non-error) `iter_done` resets the counter. Override the
threshold via `AutoloopConfig.phaseErrorCircuit`.

## Reviewer frozen memory

`reviewer_memory.md` is read at Reviewer-session start and **injected as a
frozen `<frozen_memory_snapshot>` block** into the system prompt. It stays
constant for the lifetime of that session so Claude's prefix cache hits.
Reviewer can append fresh observations to the file on disk; those edits
become visible only on the next Reviewer reset (`autoloop_reset_agent`
with `agent: 'reviewer', eager_restart: true`).

## Decisions audit

`<ledger>/decisions.jsonl` is the auditable trail of runner / dispatcher
decisions:

| Kind | When |
|---|---|
| `spawn_subagents` | Planner emits `spawn_subagents` |
| `reset_agent` | Any agent reset (manual or auto-recovery) |
| `compact` | Auto-compact fires |
| `update_push_policy` | Planner mutates the policy |
| `policy_silence_blocked` | Planner tried to silence a critical channel |
| `phase_error` | Surfaced from dispatcher to runner |
| `terminate` | Run ends (planner reason or `phase_error_circuit`) |

JSONL, one entry per line, ts-prefixed.

```

The orchestrator git-commits each iter automatically. Coder must NOT call
`git commit` itself — that confuses the diff log. **If `git commit` fails
inside an iter** (pre-commit hook reject, signing key missing, …) the
dispatcher emits a `phase_error` instead of writing `iter_artifacts`, so
the failure is visible to the runner and counts toward the circuit.

Every JSON artifact in the ledger carries a `schema_version` field (currently
`1`) to make future migrations explicit.

## Backend HTTP / SSE

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /autoloop/list` | `{ ok, runs: AutoloopState[] }` |
| `POST /autoloop/new` | `{ ok, run_id, planner_session }` — body `{ workspace, run_id?, planner_engine?, planner_model?, planner_custom_engine?, coder_engine?, coder_model?, coder_custom_engine?, reviewer_engine?, reviewer_model?, reviewer_custom_engine?, send_timeout_ms? }` |
| `GET /autoloop/<id>/state` | `{ ok, state: AutoloopState }` — also returns a `terminated`-state stub reconstructed from the registry for runs that aren't in this process's memory, so the dashboard can open historical runs without 404'ing. |
| `GET /autoloop/<id>/push_log` | `{ ok, entries: PushLogEntry[] }` — served from the ledger via `autoloopStatus`, so historical runs work the same as live ones. |
| `GET /autoloop/<id>/chat_history` | `{ ok, entries: ChatEntry[] }` — replays `<ledger>/chat.jsonl`. The dashboard fetches this when opening a run so the Planner-pane conversation survives a page refresh / cross-process / re-opening a terminated run. Returns `[]` when the file doesn't exist (e.g. runs that predate the chat-history feature). |
| `GET /autoloop/<id>/events` | SSE: `snapshot` / `message` / `state` / `push` / `iter_done` / `planner_reply` / `planner_error` / `coder_reply` / `reviewer_reply` / `terminated`. For runs that are NOT in this process's memory (terminated, or live in another process), the endpoint emits a single-shot `snapshot` + `terminated` then closes — the dashboard's existing handlers render history without hanging. |
| `POST /autoloop/<id>/chat` | **202** `{ ok, queued: true }` — body `{ text }`. Fire-and-forget: the Planner's reply streams back via the `/events` SSE channel as a `planner_reply` event (or `planner_error` on failure); the HTTP response intentionally does NOT wait for it, because first-contact replies routinely exceed reverse-proxy idle limits (e.g. Cloudflare Tunnel cuts at ~100s → 524). 400 on empty text, 404 when the run is not in this process's memory. The MCP `autoloop_chat` tool path keeps the synchronous await-and-return-reply semantics (it runs in-process). |
| `POST /autoloop/<id>/resume` | `{ ok, state }` — restore the role engine/model choices from the registry and re-create dispatcher + runner. Optional body fields `planner_custom_engine`, `coder_custom_engine`, `reviewer_custom_engine` must be supplied again for roles using `custom` because configs are intentionally not persisted. Existing engine-specific conversation resume behavior is reused where supported; `chat.jsonl` remains the visual history fallback. 404 when the registry has no record. |
| `POST /autoloop/<id>/delete` | `{ ok }` — stops the runner if still alive, scrubs the row from `~/.claw-orchestrator/autoloop-registry.jsonl`, and purges `persistedSessions` so the run cannot be `/resume`'d back. The ledger directory under `<workspace>/tasks/<run_id>/` is kept on disk. 404 if the run was not present in either memory or the registry. |

The 3-pane UI consumes these endpoints:
- **Left**: Planner chat (subscribes to `planner_reply`)
- **Center**: Coder activity (`coder_reply` + `iter_done`)
- **Right**: Reviewer verdicts (`reviewer_reply`)
- **Top bar**: state (status / iter / metric)
- **Bottom**: push_log

The UI itself ships in a separate cross-repo PR.

## `goal.json` shape

The Planner authors goal.json based on your conversation. There is no
hard schema — the Coder reads what's there and runs the eval the Planner
wrote down. A typical shape:

```jsonc
{
  "scalar": {
    "name": "test_pass_rate",
    "direction": "max",
    "extract_cmd": "bash eval.sh | grep -oE 'metric=[0-9.]+' | cut -d= -f2",
    "target": 1.0
  },
  "gates": [
    { "name": "tests_pass", "cmd": "npm test", "must": "exit-0" }
  ],
  "termination": {
    "max_iters": 10,
    "scalar_target_hit": true
  }
}
```

The Planner will riff on this shape during your chat and ask if it's right.

## Hard rules (Coder / Reviewer)

- ❌ Coder does NOT modify `plan.md`, `goal.json`, or anything under `tasks/`. Planner owns those.
- ❌ Coder does NOT manually `git commit` — orchestrator commits per iter.
- ❌ Reviewer modifies nothing outside its sandbox cwd.
- ❌ Reviewer never pings Planner / Coder for clarification — operates from artifacts only.
- ✅ Coder leaves notes in `coder_notes.md` for things future iters need to know.
- ✅ Reviewer accumulates "fakery patterns I've seen" in `reviewer_memory.md` (persists across iters).
- ✅ Reviewer defaults to `hold` under uncertainty; only `advance` after independent verification.

## Smoke test

`scripts/smoke-autoloop.ts` runs a buggy `add_two` scenario end-to-end with
Opus Planner + Sonnet × 2. Validates plan.md / goal.json commit, spawn,
iter 0 ledger artifacts (`directive` + `eval_output` + `diff.patch` +
`verdict`), and termination on `target_hit`. Cost ~$1-3, wall-clock
~5-15 min. Run with `npx tsx scripts/smoke-autoloop.ts` (requires
`~/.claude/settings.json` to have your auth env).

## Known limitations

- **`webchat` channel is a no-op** — `notifyUserFallbackChain` does not yet
  carry a webchat session id at the run level, so `channel: 'webchat'`
  always returns `channel_used: 'none'`. Use `auto` / `wechat` / `email`
  until the inbound route lands.
- **One-way push.** WeChat → Planner inbound replies are not yet wired (would
  need an openclaw-gateway tmux-passthrough route). Reply via webchat /
  `autoloop_chat`.
- **No webchat UI yet.** Backend SSE is shipped; the UI is a separate
  cross-repo PR in ChatGPT-Next-Web.
- **No fork / population mode.** Single linear iter trajectory per run.
- **Cross-run knowledge isolated.** Each run's `reviewer_memory.md` and
  `coder_notes.md` live in that run's ledger; no shared meta-store yet.
- **No cost / wall-clock budget cap.** Only `phaseErrorCircuit` + Reviewer
  hold/reject streaks bound the run; a steady-but-pointless ratchet could
  run for days. Set `max_iters` in `goal.json` to bound iter count.
- **Run state in memory.** SessionManager restart drops the live `autoloops`
  map; the on-disk ledger survives but cannot resume a running state.
- **Multi-run / same workspace** races on `git index.lock`. Run separate
  workspaces (or git worktrees) for concurrent runs.
