# Observability — Run Ledger & Spend Caps

Two related surfaces: a durable record of every turn this runtime executes, and a
spend cap that is enforced by the runtime rather than by whichever CLI happens to
support a budget flag.

## Why

`getStats()` / `getCost()` describe a **live** session. They live in memory, and
per-session history is capped and evicted, so a restart erased everything except
the resume-id registry — there was no way to answer "what did we run today, on
which engine, for how much". The run ledger is that record.

The same gap made `maxBudgetUsd` a promise the runtime did not keep: it was only
ever translated into Claude Code's `--max-budget-usd` flag, so a council of Codex
agents ran with no cap at all. The cap is now applied in `SessionManager`, which
every engine passes through.

## The ledger

- Location: `~/.claw-orchestrator/runs/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (override with
  `CLAWO_RUNS_DIR`).
- One JSON object per line, one line per completed turn — **successful or not**.
- Shards are one file per UTC day. Queries always filter on the row timestamp, so
  the shard boundary is a storage detail; `--since 24h` spans midnight correctly.
- Writes are best-effort: a ledger failure is logged at `warn` and swallowed. It
  can never break the turn it is describing.
- Nothing prunes old shards. A row is roughly 250 bytes; delete shards yourself if
  you want the history gone.

Deltas rather than totals means summing a query window gives that window's spend
without double-counting.

Every path funnels through `SessionManager.sendMessage`, so council, fanout,
autoloop, ACP, the OpenAI-compatible bridge, the MCP server and the CLI are all
covered by the same hook. `parent` is what lets you reassemble a multi-agent run:

```bash
clawo runs --parent council-1a2b3c4d
```

### Reading it

```bash
clawo runs                                   # last 24h, table
clawo runs --since 7d --engine codex         # one engine, one week
clawo runs --session my-session --json       # raw rows + summary
clawo runs --parent fanout-b5f7c886          # every agent turn of one fan-out
```

Over HTTP (GET query string or POST JSON body):

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:18796/runs?since=24h&limit=200" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Returns `{ ok, rows, summary }`, where `summary` carries `rows`, `costUsd`,
`tokensIn`, `tokensOut`, `estimatedRows` and a per-engine breakdown. The dashboard
header shows the 24-hour figure from the same endpoint.

Programmatically: `manager.getRunLedger({ since, session, engine, parent, limit })`.

## Spend caps

Set `maxBudgetUsd` on a session (or on a council / fanout, which applies it per
agent). Before each turn the runtime compares the session's cumulative
`getCost().totalUsd` against the cap and refuses to send when it has been reached:

```
Budget exceeded for session "my-session" (codex): spent $1.2400 of $1.0000 cap.
Raise maxBudgetUsd or start a new session to continue.
```

The refusal is a typed `BudgetExceededError` carrying `session`, `engine`,
`spentUsd` and `capUsd`, and it happens **before** the engine is spawned.

Notes:

- The check is "has the cap been reached", not "would this turn exceed it" — a
  turn's cost is unknown until it finishes, so the last allowed turn can overshoot.
  Size the cap accordingly.
- A cap of `0` or a negative number means _unset_, not _refuse everything_.
- Claude Code still receives `--max-budget-usd` as well: an in-CLI stop happens
  earlier and therefore costs less than an after-the-fact refusal.
- `session_list` / `GET /session/list` expose `costUsd`, `budgetUsd` and
  `budgetExhausted` so a stalled session shows _why_ it stopped taking turns.

### Zeroing a model's pricing

`pricingOverrides` zeroes the fiction that a subscription seat gets billed per token, and
the cost figures above stop reporting money nobody paid. It also **disables `maxBudgetUsd`
for that model**: the cap compares the session's accrued `getCost().totalUsd` against it,
and that number is pricing-derived, so at a rate of 0 it never reaches any cap. There is
no separate token or turn ceiling behind it.

- `engine: 'claude'` keeps the CLI's own `--max-budget-usd`, which the CLI accounts itself
  and which a zeroed registry rate does not touch. `engine: 'grok'` is outside this for a
  different reason: it writes the engine's own `total_cost_usd` into `_stats.costUsd` and
  never consults the registry, so zeroing a model's pricing does not disable its cap.
  For codex, cursor, agy, opencode and custom the runtime check is the only one.
- `maxTurns` (and `maxRounds` on a council) still bound the work, and they are the right
  ceiling to reach for once a model prices at 0.
- In a council the cap cannot bite before an agent's second turn in any case: the first
  enters with nothing accrued, and one `sendMessage` runs up to `maxTurnsPerAgent` turns
  inside the CLI, so it can pass the whole cap on its own.
- `cursor` and `opencode` sessions started without a model price by their engine default,
  which is `claude-sonnet-4-6` for both. Zeroing a Claude subscription therefore zeroes
  those default sessions too, and their reported ids (`cursor-default`, `opencode-default`)
  are display names that cannot themselves be overridden.

The override is read once, in the `SessionManager` constructor, from the plugin config.
`clawo serve`, `clawo-acp` and `clawo-mcp` do not pass one, so a ledger written by those
processes prices at registry rates whichever way this is set.

## Accuracy: which engines report real usage

`costUsd` is derived from token counts times the model's price in `models.ts`.
Where the engine reports usage, those counts are the engine's own. Where it does
not, the wrapper falls back to `estimateTokens()` (characters ÷ 4) and the row is
flagged `tokensEstimated: true`; the CLI marks those costs with a trailing `~`.

| Engine            | Token counts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `claude`          | Engine-reported — and so is the **cost**: the `result` event's `total_cost_usd` is taken as-is, so registry drift cannot affect a Claude row. It is the session running total rather than the turn's, so spend advances by the difference between turns. Proxy sessions (`baseUrl` set) are the exception: the CLI is told it is running `opus` while another provider serves the tokens, so its figure is Opus list price for someone else's model and the registry estimate is used instead |

### What "input tokens" means is not the same on every engine

Two engines can report `input` and `cached` and mean different things by them,
and the difference decides whether the cost math may subtract one from the other:

| Engine     | Its own arithmetic for one turn                      | `input` contains cached reads |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `codex`    | `total 19704 = input 19699 + output 5`               | yes                           |
| `grok`     | `total 30034 = input 19393 + output 17 + read 10624` | no                            |
| `opencode` | `total 26315 = input 58 + output 17 + read 26240`    | no                            |
| `claude`   | `input_tokens 2` against `cache_read 47371`          | no                            |

On an engine that excludes them, cached reads and cache writes are billed **on
top of** `input`, and the prompt the turn actually carried is the sum of all
three — which is what `contextPercent` measures. Reading `input` alone reports a
nearly-full context as empty on any resumed conversation, because the history
arrives as cached reads.

Anthropic bills cache _writes_ above the input rate, and the premium depends on
the TTL (1.25x for the 5-minute cache, 2x for the 1-hour one); the Claude
estimate prices both tiers from the split the engine reports. Elsewhere cache
writes are priced at the plain input rate, which is a floor rather than an exact
figure — one more reason to prefer the engine's own `total_cost_usd` where it
offers one.

So on an estimating engine the cap is best-effort. It will stop a runaway session;
it is not an accounting guarantee, and it is not a substitute for the spend limits
your provider offers.

Cost figures are also only as good as the pricing table: a model missing from
`models.ts` prices at its family default, and subscription plans (Claude Max,
ChatGPT Pro) bill nothing per token while the ledger still reports the API-rate
equivalent. Read `costUsd` as "what this would cost at API rates".

## `ok` vs `verified` (6.0.0)

A row now carries two different judgements, and conflating them is the mistake
this section exists to prevent.

- **`ok`** — the engine's own terminal verdict for that turn. Codex fails a turn
  that emits `turn.failed` while exiting 0; gemini succeeds on exit 53. It is a
  careful signal, but it is the engine talking about itself.
- **`verified`** — an acceptance contract ran against the work and every required
  check passed. That is the runtime's own measurement.

Three states, not two:

| `verified` | Means                                               | CLI column |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `true`     | A contract ran and passed                           | `yes`      |
| `false`    | A contract ran and a required check failed          | `NO`       |
| absent     | **No contract was declared. Nothing checked this.** | `—`        |

Absent is not false. An unchecked run is not a failed one, and reading it as
either would make the ledger useless for the thing it is for.

### Where the verdict comes from

`verified` is **not written at turn time**, deliberately. The turns that produce
the work all finish before the verifier that judges it, so stamping a verdict on
them as they are written would be inventing one. It is joined in at read time
from the run record via the row's `parent`, by `annotateVerdicts()`.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- A raw `runs/*.jsonl` line usually has no `verified` field. Read through
  `clawo runs` / `GET /runs` / `getRunLedger()` to get the join.
- Filtering on `--verified` happens _after_ the join. Pushing the filter into the
  ledger read would match on a field no row carries yet and return nothing.

### Other new row fields

| Field                      | Source                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `evidenceId`, `contractId` | Joined from the run record                                                                                                                                      |
| `nodeKind`                 | The kernel node the turn belonged to (`agent`, `council`, `verifier`, …)                                                                                        |
| `repoLang`                 | Detected from a manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, …). Never guessed — a wrong label would corrupt the comparison the field exists to enable |
| `taskKind`                 | Caller-declared only. Never inferred from the prompt                                                                                                            |

All are optional and absent on rows written before 6.0.0. The reader already
skips unknown and missing keys, so old shards stay readable; nothing backfills
them, because we cannot know retroactively.

```bash
clawo runs --since 7d --verified     # only turns whose contract passed
clawo runs --since 7d --refuted      # only turns whose contract failed
clawo runs --parent wf-abc123        # every turn of one workflow run
```
