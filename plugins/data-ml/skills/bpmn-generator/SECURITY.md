# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email: **stieges99@gmail.com** with subject `[bpmn-generator security]`. Please do not file public issues for unpatched vulnerabilities.

Expect an initial response within 7 days. Confirmed issues: fix or coordinated disclosure within 30 days for most cases, longer for complex ones.

## Threat model

The BPMN Generator runs in three deployment shapes with different trust boundaries:

1. **Library** (Node module via `npm install`): caller is trusted. No special handling.
2. **CLI** (`node bpmn/pipeline.js ...`): local user is trusted. Same as library mode.
3. **HTTP API / MCP server**: network is untrusted. **This is the surface that needs hardening.**

### HTTP API threats and mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation | Where |
|---|---|---|
| SSRF via `callbackUrl` | Protocol allowlist (http/https), denylist for IPv4 private ranges (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x, 127.x, 169.254.x), IPv6 (::1, fc00::/7, fe80::/10), DNS-resolve hostname and re-check resolved IPs | `scripts/http-server.js` — `validateCallbackUrl` + `validateCallbackUrlAsync` |
| Unauthorized access | API key required in production (`BPMN_API_KEY` env), fail-fast startup if missing while `NODE_ENV=production` | `scripts/http-server.js` — `startupCheck` |
| Resource exhaustion | Body size cap (10 MB), per-IP rate limit (30 req/min) | `scripts/http-server.js` |
| Malformed input crashing the pipeline | Strict JSON Schema validation at `/api/v1/generate`, `/api/v1/validate`, and `/api/v1/orchestrate` (when `body.logicCore` is provided), against `references/input-schema.json` | `scripts/bpmn/schema-gate.js` (wired in `http-server.js`) |
| LLM output injection | LLM output flows through the same schema gate before reaching the pipeline; the LLM never writes to disk directly | `scripts/orchestrator.js` → schema-gate → `runPipeline` |
| Sensitive data in audit log | Audit log path is configurable via `AUDIT_LOG_PATH` for secure storage (encrypted volumes, append-only filesystems) | `scripts/audit.js` |

### Out of scope

- Denial-of-service from clients with valid API keys (operate behind a gateway / WAF).
- Compromise of the LLM endpoint configured via `body.llmConfig.baseUrl` — the API forwards LLM calls to user-provided endpoints with user-provided keys.
- Container / host hardening — running the service in a hardened container (read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities, non-root user) is the operator's responsibility.

## Dependencies and supply chain

The runtime dependency surface is deliberately small — `elkjs`, `bpmn-moddle`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `ajv`, `ajv-formats`. Adding to it requires prior discussion (see `CLAUDE.md`); every one of the five was a deliberate choice. Supported Node is `>=20` (declared in `scripts/package.json`); CI tests 20 and 22.

### The gate

Every pull request, every push to `master`, and a weekly cron run execute `.github/scripts/dep-audit-gate.mjs`. It parses `npm audit` and **fails the build on any `high` or `critical` advisory not covered by a valid exception**. Moderate and low findings are reported without blocking.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | clean, or every failing-severity finding is validly exempted |
| 1 | policy violation |
| 2 | tooling error — audit unrunnable, policy malformed |

Exit 2 exists so that an audit which *could not run* never reads as an audit that *found nothing*. The gate has no dependencies of its own and audits from the lockfile, so it needs no `npm ci`.

Reproduce locally from the repository root:

```bash
node .github/scripts/dep-audit-gate.mjs      # the gate's verdict
cd scripts && npm audit                      # the raw report
```

A second job in the same workflow runs `npm audit signatures`, which answers a different question: not "is a known advisory open?" but "did these artifacts really come from the registry unmodified?". It is non-blocking at present.

**What the gate is not.** It guards against regression and inattention, not against a hostile pull request. On a fork PR the policy file, the lockfile *and the gate script itself* are checked out from the PR head, so a determined fork can simply rewrite the gate. This is inherent to every in-repo CI check; the actual controls there are human review and branch protection. The registry is pinned to `registry.npmjs.org` in the gate so that a project-level `.npmrc` cannot redirect the advisory lookup, but that closes one hole rather than making the gate a security boundary.

Two further caveats. GitHub disables scheduled workflows after 60 days of repository inactivity, so the weekly run is not a self-maintaining safety net. And the gate enforces what the lockfile resolves — it does not prevent someone from regenerating the lockfile and losing a pinned resolution; it only makes that regression visible on the next run.

### Adopting new versions

The Dependabot `cooldown` (7 days, 30 for majors) gives a freshly published version time to be found out before it is adopted — the 2026 npm compromises were published through legitimate maintainer accounts, so a valid signature is not by itself evidence of a benign release.

**A manual `npm update` bypasses that cooldown entirely.** When closing an advisory by hand this is a deliberate trade — the open vulnerability is a certainty, the compromised-release risk is a possibility — but make it consciously and check what you are adopting:

```bash
npm view <package>@<version> time    # how old is this release?
npm audit signatures                 # did it come from the registry unmodified?
```

Worth weighting the decision by reachability: a package this project never loads (the MCP SDK's HTTP-transport subtree, for instance) carries far less risk from a same-day adoption than one on the untrusted-input path such as `ajv`/`fast-uri`.

### Accepted risks

Exceptions live in `.github/dependency-policy.json`. Each requires `reason`, `whyNotFixed`, `reviewTrigger`, `opened` and `expires`; the gate refuses to run against a policy missing any of them. **`expires` is mandatory and capped at 180 days, and an expired entry fails the build** — an accepted risk that nobody re-examines is not an accepted risk, it is a forgotten one. Where an exception rests on a claim that some code path is never reached, `voidIf.importsFound` names the specifiers that would disprove it; the gate greps first-party product code for them on every run, so the claim is machine-checked rather than asserted in a comment.

| Package | Severity | Why it is not exploitable here | Re-review | Expires |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `brace-expansion` | high | DoS via brace expansion. Dev-tree only — absent from `npm audit --omit=dev`. Reached solely through jest's `minimatch`; the patterns expanded come from jest config and repo file names, never from untrusted input, and no shipped artifact contains it. | jest's tree reaches `minimatch>=10` | 2026-10-23 |
| `@hono/node-server`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | moderate | Path traversal in `serve-static`, Windows only. Belongs to the MCP SDK's HTTP/SSE transports, which this project never loads — `mcp-bpmn-server.js` uses `StdioServerTransport` only and `http-server.js` uses `node:http` directly. One advisory, two findings, because npm reports the SDK separately through the effects chain. | the SDK admits `@hono/node-server >= 2.0.5` | 2027-01-21 |

Neither is fixable by upgrading: `brace-expansion` is affected in every version except 5.0.8, and 5.0.8 dropped the default export that both pinned `minimatch` copies consume; for `@hono/node-server`, npm's only proposed remedy is a semver-major *downgrade* of the MCP SDK. The full reasoning, including the measured failure modes, is in the policy file.

To report a vulnerability in a dependency, use the same address and timeline as above.

## Recommended deployment

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
BPMN_API_KEY=<32-byte random string, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`>
AUDIT_LOG_PATH=/var/log/bpmn-generator/audit.jsonl
DEAD_LETTER_PATH=/var/lib/bpmn-generator/dead-letter
PORT=3000
```

Place the service behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, or a load balancer) that handles TLS termination, IP filtering if needed, and a second layer of rate limiting.

### Quick check the gate works

```bash
# 1. Production refuses to start without a key
NODE_ENV=production node scripts/http-server.js
#  → exits non-zero with "Refusing to start in production without BPMN_API_KEY"

# 2. SSRF is blocked (run server in another shell first)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/generate \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"logicCore":{"nodes":[{"id":"a","type":"startEvent"}],"edges":[]},"callbackUrl":"http://169.254.169.254/"}'
#  → 400 { "error": "callbackUrl must not target internal networks" }

# 3. Schema-gate rejects malformed input
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/generate \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"logicCore":{"banana":"phone"}}'
#  → 400 { "status": "schema_error", "errors": [...] }
```

## Versions covered

Security fixes are issued for the latest released minor version (currently 3.x). Older versions may receive fixes for critical vulnerabilities at maintainer discretion.
