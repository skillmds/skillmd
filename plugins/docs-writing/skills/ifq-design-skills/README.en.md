## Thesis

Ask many agents to design something, and they will hand you one of two things: a **template-flavored page trying too hard**, or a **formatted explainer that never becomes a deliverable**. Neither ships.

This skill is what gets in the way of that. It is not a palette file. It is not a logo sticker.

It is **a way of making things**. Treat a web page like an editorial spread. An animation like a teaser cut. A slide deck like a launch-night master. A business card like a print job with real bleed.

The ifq.ai signature lives inside that craft. First you see the content. **Only on the second look do you notice — this is ifq.ai's hand.**

---

## Install

```bash
npx skills add peixl/ifq-design-skills
```

> `peixl/ifq-design-skills` is the GitHub shorthand → <https://github.com/peixl/ifq-design-skills>

Then just talk to the agent. The skill routes, picks templates, and verifies itself.

**Zero-install core loop:** HTML authoring + `npm run preview -- <file>` + `npm run verify:lite -- <file>` need only Node. Do not install Playwright, Chromium, Python, or ffmpeg unless the user explicitly asks for MP4 / GIF / PDF / PPTX export or automated screenshots.

**Marketplace proof:** `npm run validate` runs smoke's 14 local gates (template index, references, script syntax, script safety invariants, secret hygiene, invisible Unicode controls, automatic install-script posture, default HTML network policy, and well-known metadata) plus the 12-mode eval contract. Before ClawHub / VirusTotal publication, use [references/marketplace-quality.md](references/marketplace-quality.md) and submit only the public repo or report URL, not private user assets.

**Regression-backed evolution:** `evals/evals.json` covers all 12 modes. Each scenario records both `user_value` and the `agent_contract`, so the skill can improve without drifting into prose-only output. `npm run validate` runs both smoke checks and eval validation.

**One-liners for every agent**:

```bash
# Hermes (Nous Research)
hermes skills install github:peixl/ifq-design-skills

# OpenClaw / ClawHub
openclaw skills install peixl/ifq-design-skills

# Claude Code (personal)
git clone https://github.com/peixl/ifq-design-skills ~/.claude/skills/ifq-design-skills

# Codex CLI / OpenCode / any AGENTS.md-aware runtime
git clone https://github.com/peixl/ifq-design-skills

# Share across every agent (recommended)
git clone https://github.com/peixl/ifq-design-skills ~/.agents/skills/ifq-design-skills
```

**60-second quickstart:** Just talk to the agent after install. 3 one-liner examples → [references/quickstart.md](references/quickstart.md).

## Human + Agent contract

This skill is built around a simple growth principle: make the AI agent do more deterministic work, instead of making the human write better prompts.

| Audience | Promise | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| Human users | One sentence can become a previewable, iterable, export-ready visual artifact | `verify:lite` + `preview`, with export gates only when export is requested |
| AI agents | No guessing: classify the mode, fork a template, read the needed reference, then deliver | short `SKILL.md` router + `assets/templates/INDEX.json` + 12-mode eval suite |
| Marketplaces | Clear install surface, restrained dependency surface, machine-readable safety signals | `.well-known/**`, `metadata.openclaw.requires`, `npm run verify:publish` |
| Maintainers | Every upgrade must prove the skill still ships artifacts, not just prose | `npm run validate` runs smoke plus eval contracts |

The principle is: **let AI deliver more leverage**. Humans express intent, constraints, and taste; the agent owns fact checks, routing, template choice, layout production, placeholder cleanup, preview, and export prep.

---

## For AI agents (30-second onboarding)

This repo is shaped for agents. The root [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) points at [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md), and `SKILL.md` is now the short router entrypoint — whichever your runtime reads first (Claude Code · Codex · OpenCode · OpenClaw · Hermes · Cursor), the three moves are the same:

1. **Read** [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) through the 30-second entrypoint (~100 lines). Trigger boundaries, tier policy, routing, and verification are all there.
2. **Route** via [references/modes.md](references/modes.md) → pick one of 12 modes → fork the template listed in [assets/templates/INDEX.json](assets/templates/INDEX.json). **Never start from blank HTML.**
3. **Verify** (default Tier 0 · zero install): `npm run verify:lite -- <file>` for the placeholder scan, then `npm run preview -- <file>` for a `file://` URL your browser tool (or the user) can open.

Do not turn first run into setup work. Ship a visible HTML artifact first, then report the file path, mode, template, verification result, and use-affecting caveats. Only claim exported files after the user asks for them, the corresponding command has passed, and the output file has been inspected.

`agents/openai.yaml` supplies the UI display name, short description, default prompt, and IFQ icon paths for agents or marketplaces that render skill chips/cards.

**Declarative capability / permission / security data** lives in `SKILL.md` as single-line JSON `metadata`, so OpenClaw / ClawHub / Hermes can read `metadata.openclaw.requires` and security signals without parsing prose:

- Reads the skill root; writes only under the user's workspace.
- Shell allowlist: `npm run preview | verify:lite | smoke | install:export`, plus `ffmpeg` if the user asks for MP4/GIF.
- Network: `WebSearch` (for the #0 fact-verification rule). Produced HTML is local-first by default and does not load Google Fonts; Google Fonts / unpkg / jsDelivr are explicit opt-ins only when a task needs them.
- **Node/Python scripts are `child_process`-free, `eval`-free, and make zero outbound network calls.** The few shell export helpers call `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` only when the user explicitly asks for MP4/GIF/audio export. Built-in templates load no remote runtime CSS/JS by default, keeping static security scanners (ClawHub etc.) cleaner.

Stay in Tier 0 unless the user actually asks for an export. Only then run `npm run install:export` (Tier 2, pulls Playwright + Chromium + friends) or `pip install playwright` (Tier 1, for headless multi-viewport screenshots).

```

Unpacked:

1. **Editorial contrast** — Newsreader serif with JetBrains Mono. Not a random pairing.
2. **Rust ledger** — That vertical rule is ifq.ai's spine. More IFQ than any wordmark.
3. **Mono field note** — The `ifq.ai / live system` and `ifq.ai / 2026` microlines.
4. **Quiet URL** — No CTA shouting. The domain appears once, bottom-right.
5. **Signal spark** — One small lit point. The only graphic accent on the page.
6. **Warm paper** — Background is `#FAF7F2`, not `#FFFFFF`. Cold white has no temperature.
7. **Ledger rhythm** — Every spacing value sits on `4 · 8 · 12 · 16 · 24 · 32 · 48 · 64`. Nothing by feel.

Viewers won't count the seven. They'll only say "this one looks a cut above."

**A cut above = one hand = the ifq.ai Ambient Brand.**

---

## Five marks

The Ambient Brand is five environmental markers. Every deliverable weaves in at least three.

| Mark | What it is | Where it lives |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Signal Spark** | 8-point spark. Intelligence, lit | hero · motion cue · stamp center |
| **Rust Ledger** | Terracotta verticals, dividers, numbering, axes | hero · slides · infographic · dashboard |
| **Mono Field Note** | `ifq.ai / 2026` in JetBrains Mono | footer · closing · corner |
| **Quiet URL** | The domain, once, quietly | footer · meta · end card |
| **Editorial Contrast** | Newsreader italic + JetBrains Mono + warm paper | global typographic frame |

Not decoration. Layout grammar.

---

## Co-brand

| Context | Where IFQ sits |
|---------|----------------|
| **IFQ-owned work** (ifq.ai and its products) | Everyone on stage: wordmark · spark · field note · quiet URL |
| **Third-party / client work** | Client brand first. IFQ retreats to authored layer: rhythm, temperature, colophon, hand-drawn icons, export finish |
| **White-label required** | Drop the explicit wordmark and field note. Keep editorial contrast, ledger rhythm, proof-first craft |

**IFQ can go invisible. It never goes missing.** The craft itself is the signature.

---

## 12 modes

| # | Mode | Triggered by | Delivers |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| M-01 | Launch Film | launch video · product film | HTML/keyposter first; MP4/GIF after export |
| M-02 | Portfolio | personal site · about | one-pager + 5 direction variants |
| M-03 | Whitepaper | whitepaper · annual report · research PDF | printable HTML; PDF after export verification |
| M-04 | Dashboard | command center · KPI · monitor | dense dashboard |
| M-05 | Compare | A vs B · benchmark | matrix + cited sources |
| M-06 | Onboarding | new-user flow · demo | 3–5 interactive screens |
| M-07 | Changelog | release notes · dev log | vertical timeline |
| M-08 | Keynote | talk deck · master template | HTML deck; PPTX/PDF after export verification |
| M-09 | Social Kit | IG / Xiaohongshu / OG card | multi-size statics |
| M-10 | Card / Invite | business card · invite · VIP | SVG/HTML source; print PDF after export verification |
| M-11 | Brand Diagnosis | audit · upgrade | report + three directions |
| M-12 | Full Brand | brand from scratch | logo + palette + type + six applications |

Routing: **mode trigger → direction advisor fallback → Junior Designer main branch**.

Full protocol: [references/modes.md](references/modes.md).

## Six layers

It reads as IFQ not because of color, but because six layers move together.

| Layer | Role | Key file |
|-------|------|----------|
| **01 · Context Engine** | Grow the design from existing context. Never from blank | [design-context.md](references/design-context.md) |
| **02 · Asset Protocol** | Capture facts, logo, product shots, UI before pixels move | [fact-and-asset-protocol.md](references/fact-and-asset-protocol.md) · [workflow.md](references/workflow.md) |
| **03 · House Marks** | Weave the five ambient marks into the layout | [ifq-brand-spec.md](references/ifq-brand-spec.md) · [assets/ifq-brand/](assets/ifq-brand/) |
| **04 · Style Recipes** | Style as recipes + scene templates. Not mystique | [design-styles.md](references/design-styles.md) · [ifq-native-recipes.md](references/ifq-native-recipes.md) |
| **05 · Output Compiler** | One export chain: HTML → MP4 / GIF / PPTX / PDF | [scripts/](scripts/) |
| **06 · Proof Loop** | Screenshot + click-test + smoke + export check | [verification.md](references/verification.md) · [smoke-test.mjs](scripts/smoke-test.mjs) |

## Verification

**Lite tier (default, zero-dependency):**

```bash
npm run preview -- path/to/design.html       # prints a file:// URL for your browser tool or user
npm run verify:lite -- path/to/design.html   # pure static placeholder scan (YYYY / {…} / lorem / empty data-ifq-*)
npm run smoke                                # one-minute skill health check
npm run evals:validate                       # 20-scenario regression contract (12 modes + 8 edge cases)
npm run quality:score                        # 38-check quality score (Discovery / Implementation / Structure / Expertise / Security)
```

No Playwright, no Chromium, no Python. Runs on macOS / Linux / Windows out of the box.

**Deep tier (on-demand, only when you export or need CI automation):**

```bash
npm run install:export                              # pulls playwright + pdf-lib + pptxgenjs + sharp + Chromium in one shot
npm run install:browsers                            # install Chromium only (no other export deps)
python scripts/verify.py path/to/design.html       # headless multi-viewport screenshots + console-error capture
npm run export:pdf -- path/to/deck.html             # export PDF (requires install:export first)
npm run export:pptx -- path/to/deck.html            # export editable PPTX (requires install:export first)
npm run export:stage-pdf -- path/to/deck.html       # export per-stage PDF (requires install:export first)
npm run render:video -- path/to/film.html           # render MP4 (requires ffmpeg + install:export)
```

Escalate to the deep tier only when you actually need automated screenshots, click-tests, or MP4 / PDF / PPTX export. See [references/verification.md](references/verification.md).

## Showcase

Open the HTML files in `demos/` to see real output quality. The quieter live case is author peixl's personal site, [peixl.ifq.ai](http://peixl.ifq.ai/) — designed end to end with IFQ Design Skills, and a best-practice M-02 Portfolio example: not a resume stack, but a restrained one-page identity shaped through warm paper, ledger rhythm, mono field notes, and a quiet URL.

| Demo | File / URL | What it shows |
|------|------|---------------|
| peixl personal site | [peixl.ifq.ai](http://peixl.ifq.ai/) | Live M-02 Portfolio best practice designed with IFQ Design Skills |
| Landing Page | `demos/hero-landing-showcase.html` | Editorial hero + rust ledger + spark animation |
| Dashboard | `demos/dashboard-showcase.html` | Command center + KPI strip + sparkline grid |
| Slide Deck | `demos/deck-showcase.html` | 5-slide keynote + field-note colophon |
