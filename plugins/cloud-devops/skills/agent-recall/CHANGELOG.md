## [3.4.43] — 2026-08-13

Patch release: zero-action memory on non-hook hosts (Train C), plus two enumeration-driven hardening classes.

### Added

- **Zero-action lifecycle on non-hook MCP hosts (Train C)**: the MCP server now carries the memory loop itself where no hooks exist (Codex, Cursor, raw MCP clients) — every tool call appends a scrubbed working-memory gist (single `registerTool` wrap; future tools inherit capture by construction), orphaned sessions are rescued into cards by ANY host's `session_start`, and graceful exit (stdin close / SIGTERM) distills the session immediately. kill -9 falls through to rescue by design.
- **Dual-stack ownership gate**: on hosts where lifecycle hooks are active (detected via the observed `CLAUDECODE`/`CLAUDE_CODE_*` environment of spawned servers), server-side capture and exit-distill stand down — hooks own the lifecycle; no duplicate cards or recency entries.

### Fixed

- **Root-resolution bypass class in the CLI** (full enumeration, 12 sites): `--root` was silently ignored by `ar stats` and `ar setup supabase --backfill` (both hit the real store), plus 10 further internal sites — all now resolve through the canonical store root.
- **Deep hook-failure visibility**: 19 previously-silent catch sites across the hook-end/hook-start call graph now record to hook health (error-path semantics unchanged); 10 remaining silent catches are individually justified. Also fixed an unguarded directory read that could crash `sessionEnd()` entirely.
- **MCP ambient capture records `cwd`** so sessions on hookless hosts file under the real project instead of `auto`; recency index deduplicates by session at read time (closes a cross-process double-append race); orphan rescue now runs before continuity assembly so the same `session_start` that rescues a session also shows it.

## [3.4.42] — 2026-08-04

Patch release: the working-memory tier — minutes-level, crash-proof memory. Like a brain: long-term can decay, but "what happened 5 minutes ago" must survive anything.

### Added

- **Working memory (`working-memory/<sid>.jsonl`)**: every user prompt appends one scrubbed, byte-capped line (piggybacked on the existing per-prompt hook — no new process, ~µs hot path, per-session files so concurrent windows can never race each other). Prompts are injection- and secret-scrubbed at the single capture choke point before touching disk.
- **Crash rescue**: at session start, working-memory files older than an hour whose session never produced a card are distilled into a rescue card + continuity entry, then consolidated away — a killed/crashed session now becomes searchable memory at the next session start instead of vanishing.
- **Cross-window live line**: session start surfaces what another live session was just doing (`🔴 live · … `), newest only, omitted when none.
- **Sleep consolidation**: a normal hook-end absorbs the session into its card and deletes the working-memory file — the verbatim minutes-level tier is never archived, by design.
- **`resurrect` freshest tier**: live working-memory joins raw archives and cards as a resurrect source.

### Fixed

- Session-id fallback unified between capture and cleanup: when no session id is resolvable, working memory is skipped entirely rather than written to a shared file.
- Working-memory slug guessing prefers an existing on-disk project (parity with the v3.4.41 namer, pinned by a cross-package drift-guard test).

## [3.4.41] — 2026-07-31

Patch release: the continuity wave — born from a same-day incident where a fully-captured session was unretrievable the next session. Capture was never the problem; surfacing was.

### Fixed

- **Split-brain hook-end filing**: the raw archive used the transcript-derived project guess while the journal-summary path ignored it — one session's data landed in two project directories. Both paths now share a single `resolveSessionProject()` resolution (explicit `--project` still wins).
- **Blind project guessing**: the old namer frequency-counted a path regex over raw transcript bytes — including hook-injected startup boilerplate, which routinely misfiled sessions (and misleads grep-based forensics the same way). The namer now prefers the transcript's own `cwd` signal, excludes attachment/boilerplate records, claims an existing store slug when one matches, and only mints a new slug above an evidence threshold (else `auto`, with confidence + candidates recorded in the card for later re-filing).
- **Raw archive truncation direction**: the 80K cap kept the head and cut the tail — exactly where decisions and next-steps live. Now head ~20K + tail ~60K, byte-accurate: the old bytes-vs-UTF16 comparison also duplicated small CJK sessions wholesale, and hard byte cuts could split multi-byte characters (shared UTF-8-safe truncation helper).
- **Test-suite pollution of the real sync-error log**: `logSyncError` hardcoded `os.homedir()` and bypassed `getRoot()`, so store-scoped test suites wrote their failures into the real user log (50 of 51 recent entries were fixtures). It now respects the same root resolution as the rest of the store.
- **Accidental raw indexing + verbatim collision**: `journalDirs(includeArchive)` no longer descends into `archive/raw/` (rollup archives unchanged), and drill-down verbatim keys gained an explicit `archive` kind so raw dumps stop colliding with `${date}--` journal filenames.
- **Recency-ledger roll race**: the rolling truncate no longer rewrites the file on every append past the cap (slack window + best-effort lock), closing a rename race that could silently drop a concurrent session's entry.

### Added

- **⏪ Continuity Card**: session_start (full, lite, and CLI hook-start) opens with the most recent sessions across ALL projects — recency-first, cwd-independent — sourced from a new rolling `recent-sessions.jsonl` ledger appended at hook-end.
- **Unconditional session cards**: hook-end always distills a mechanical card (`<date>--card--<sid>.md`: title, artifacts from Write/Edit tool calls, Linear refs, decisions, next steps) into the normal journal layer — no longer gated on same-day `ar capture`. Cards ride the existing retrieval + consolidation pipelines; extraction is record-aware and excludes `tool_result` echoes (single-sourced in `storage/extraction.ts`).
- **Explicit archive fallback in recall**: when palace/journal/insight confidence sits below the medium floor, an explicit raw-archive source surfaces `[raw-archive · low-confidence]` excerpts with provenance paths — bounded by the caller's `limit`.
- **Fail-loud hook health**: hook failures persist to `hook-health.jsonl` + a derived state file; `ar health` prints it, and session start leads with a ⚠️ line when there were failures in the last 24h.
- **`ar resurrect [query] [--days N] [--json]`**: incident-recovery forensics as one read-only command — finds "dead" sessions across every project slug (cards, raw archives, recency ledger), ranks by recency × keyword, and renders a continuity brief (goal, artifacts, Linear refs, next steps, provenance).

## [3.4.40] — 2026-07-27

Patch release: the naming-at-scale wave — slug/theme quality, hot-path performance, store self-description, and the hygiene "trash scan".

### Fixed

- **Theme/sig classifier over-matching**: `autoClassifyTheme`/`autoClassifySig` matched vocabulary, not conditions — `\bmcp\b` treated the hyphen in "novada-mcp" as a word boundary, so any summary mentioning that project name classified as `mcp-unavailable` (measured: 29/32 = 90.6% of one project's journal filenames). Classifiers now require co-occurring condition signals in the same clause; misclassification drops to 1/31 with the survivor genuine. Two shadow epidemics (`version-bump`, `agent-fix`) that would have surfaced behind the first fix are fixed in the same pass. Enums unchanged — old filenames parse forever.
- **`alignment` KPI staleness**: the session_start scan-dedup initially threaded a pre-write snapshot into `getCorrectionKPIs`, making `alignment` null exactly when a never-retrieved P0 was first surfaced. The KPI call site reads fresh after this call's own retrieved-outcome writes (caught by independent integration review, pinned as a regression test).

### Added

- **`ar hygiene` — the trash scan**: 8 detection-only store checks (junk/test project dirs, ambient-counter accumulation, theme epidemics, case-fold fork dirs, stale derived caches, root-level credential patterns, missing `corrections/_index.md`, reserved-word slugs) with a baseline so repeat runs report only NEW findings. Detection-only by contract: it never deletes, renames, or quarantines; every finding carries an `agent_instruction`; secret findings report pattern name + line number, never the matched text. Fresh RED findings → exit 1 (cron-friendly). Not part of the MCP tool surface.
- **Store-root `MANIFEST.md`** (write-once, generated beside the per-project `MEMORY-PROTOCOL.md`): makes a bare store directory self-describing for any agent with filesystem access — cold-agent read order, sync / never-sync / regenerable file classification (`config.json` explicitly marked never-sync, do-not-read), and a condensed naming-grammar cheat-sheet. All paths store-root-relative; the `MEMORY-PROTOCOL.md` template's hardcoded `~` path is now root-relative too.

### Performance

- **session_start corrections scans: 4 → 2.** One shared snapshot feeds P0 surfacing, prediction, and recognition; the KPI computation deliberately re-reads after this call's own outcome writes (see Fixed). At the measured 50k-file extreme this cuts ~2s from every session_start.
- **Legacy journal index (`index.md`/`index.jsonl`) is incremental**: only files with mtime newer than the index are re-read; unchanged rows merge from the previous `index.jsonl` by filename. It previously re-read every journal body TWICE per `journal_write`/rollup/merge/archive (2.8s at 50k files; now pays only for what changed). Kept rather than removed because a live MCP resource (`agent-recall://{project}/index`) reads it verbatim.

## [3.4.39] — 2026-07-27

Patch release: the 2026-07-25 Codex audit fixes (Release Trains A–D, all 8 findings reproduced-then-fixed) plus ambient-recall groundwork.

### Fixed

- **Silent correction loss on slug collision** (found by a performance round-table during this release, reproduced before fixing): two distinct same-day corrections whose rules sanitize to the same slug were written to the same file — the second silently overwrote the first while both callers saw `written: true`. Pure-CJK rules made this the common case (every Chinese-only rule collapsed to the bare `unnamed` fallback). Two-layer fix: `sanitizeName`'s degenerate fallback is now `unnamed-<hash8>` (content-hashed, deterministic), and brand-new correction writes disambiguate an occupied filename with an id-hash suffix inside the slug field (the `--` delimiter grammar is preserved). Same-rule merging is unchanged. This also stops distinct pure-CJK **project names** from collapsing into one shared `unnamed` store directory. **Migration note:** a store that already has a bare `unnamed/` project directory (only possible if a pre-3.4.39 session ran with a fully-degenerate project name) will see new sessions write to the correctly-hashed directory instead — the old commingled directory stays readable on disk but no longer accumulates writes. That directory was already a defect (every degenerate project name shared it); resuming writes into it would preserve the bug.
- **Concurrency**: `recordOutcome` / `retractCorrection` / merge-consolidation read-modify-write cycles now run inside the per-project file lock — concurrent sessions can no longer drop outcome-ledger rows or regenerate a stale index (TOW2-321).
- **Retrieval fusion**: `smart_recall` cross-source fusion accumulates RRF scores on a canonical excerpt identity instead of object identity — the same fact found by 2–3 searchers now ranks above single-source hits, with `alsoFoundIn` provenance and true pre-fusion `total_searched` counts. Insight items carry a real fusion identity (title + excerpt), not severity + tags (TOW2-330, TOW2-331).
- **CJK matching**: the check-action tokenizer is CJK-aware — Han runs segment via `Intl.Segmenter` with bigram fallback, and the token length floor is script-scoped — so Chinese P0 rules now match Chinese action descriptions (TOW2-325). Chinese absolute-prohibition markers (禁止 / 不得 / 不能 / 不要, with idiom guards for 不得不 / 不能不 and benign 不要-completions) join the durable-rule behavioral gate (TOW2-326).

### Added

- **Outcomes ledger rebuild**: `ar outcomes rebuild --project <slug> [--apply] [--json]` + a store-doctor divergence check — counters are recomputable from the append-only ledger; malformed rows are quarantined, dry-run is the default, apply runs inside the same lock as normal writes (TOW2-322).
- **SDK modern composite API**: `sessionStart` / `remember` / `recall` / `sessionEnd` / `check` on the `AgentRecall` class — 1:1 with the MCP tools of the same names, additive alongside the existing low-level API (TOW2-323).
- **3-tier host profiles**: hooks (Tier A, Claude Code) / mcp-instructions (Tier B, Codex, Cursor, raw MCP) / manual (Tier C, SDK + CLI), with `AR_HOST` override; `lifecycleInstructions(tier)` is the one canonical source both MCP server instructions and skill docs render from (TOW2-327).
- **Idempotent lifecycle + local telemetry**: `session_start` claims are once-per-session-per-project, `session_end` dedupes by content fingerprint, and an append-only JSONL telemetry ledger (`lifecycleStats()`) records event counts by host tier — local-only, never leaves the machine (TOW2-328).
- **Pre-action P0 blocking in `check`**: pass `action_description` and the default `check` tool consults active P0 corrections before the action runs — no extra tool call on the 5-tool surface (TOW2-329).
- **Ambient topic profile (CLI)**: a rolling 8-turn topic state with distance decay powers ambient-recall precision tiers, so background conversation informs what gets recalled (TOW2-340).

### CI

- Full test suite + typecheck wired into `ci.yml` (SHA-pinned actions, failure-log artifact). The 2 tracked known gaps (SDK root isolation TOW2-324; standalone-prohibition capture design TOW2-326) are `todo`-marked, so a red CI now means new breakage only (TOW2-318).

### Security

- 10/12 `npm audit` findings resolved via transitive bumps (TOW2-320). The remaining 2 are the documented Hono / MCP-SDK pair whose fix requires a transport-removing SDK downgrade — tracked, not silently accepted.

## [3.4.38] — 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Naming System v2** (spec: `docs/proposals/2026-07-20-naming-v2-spec.md`, designed by a 5-seat round table). Two-audience ruling: the filename is the human/triage index (immutable-at-birth fields only); a materialized per-store `_index.md` is the machine fast-path (mutable state lives there, never in the path).
- **Shared sanitizer** `sanitizeName()`: lowercase + Unicode NFC + byte-capped (not UTF-16 chars) + structurally cannot emit `--` — one function behind project slugs, journal/correction/skill slugs.
- **Materialized indexes**, regenerated atomically on write (regen failure never fails the write): `corrections/_index.md` (severity-first: severity/failure_class/status/date/rule), `journal/_index.md` (last 10, filename-derived), `palace/rooms/_index.md` (per-room overview).
- **v2 journal grammar**: `none` sig/theme segments are omitted, never printed; 4th parser generation (SaveType-anchored, enum-membership classification) alongside the 3 legacy generations.
- **v2 corrections grammar**: `{date}--{rule-slug}.json` — slug derives from the rule (leading interjections stripped, EN + CJK incl. full-width punctuation), no longer from the trigger utterance.
- **Source-level guard test**: raw `projects` path construction outside `storage/paths.ts` now fails the suite — the bypass class is unrecreatable.

### Fixed

- **Case-fold corpus split**: `agentrecall` vs `AgentRecall` resolve to one directory via `resolveProjectDirName()` (existing-dir case-insensitive reuse; deterministic pick + stderr warning when a fork already exists). ~21 call sites that built project paths independently now route through `paths.ts`.
- **Byte-vs-char filename budgets**: component caps are byte-aware (CJK/emoji slugs can no longer exceed the 255-byte filesystem limit while passing a char cap).
- **Rewrite forks**: `retractCorrection`/`recordOutcome`/merge-consolidation and skill rewrites reuse the record's on-disk filename instead of recomputing it — a grammar change can no longer orphan-duplicate existing records.
- **Vanishing-project hazard**: `isJournalFile` excludes underscore-prefixed files; an `_index.md` can no longer knock a project off the status board.
- **Same-day journal TOCTOU**: decide-filename + write now run under a per-project file lock (lock keys case-normalized).
- **FSRS reinforce lookup**: case-insensitive — legacy skills with uppercase slugs no longer silently starve of reinforcement.

### Migration

- Zero-rename, new-writes-only. Existing files keep their names permanently; all legacy generations keep parsing. Room/topic-level case-folding is explicitly deferred (spec §7).

## [3.4.37] — 2026-07-14

- RD-1: `failure_class` at capture (9-value enum) + cross-project recurrence join at session-end; Phase-0 eval PASS (first cross-project detection, 0/53 stride FPs). Experimental `experimental/harness-kit/`. Full notes: `warroom/changelog.html` and the [v3.4.37 GitHub Release](https://github.com/Goldentrii/AgentRecall-X/releases/tag/v3.4.37). *(Entry backfilled 2026-07-20 — this release shipped without a CHANGELOG.md entry.)*

## [3.4.36] — 2026-07-05

### BREAKING

- **C3 heed-instrumentation semantic break (boundary: 2026-07-03).** The default `session_end` outcome for a retrieved correction with no positive trigger evidence has changed from `"heeded"` to `"unknown"`. A `"heeded"` verdict now requires at least one `"triggered"` outcome written by `check_action` during the same day. Pre-C3 `heeded` events where `evidence` contains `"default-heeded"` are instrument-generated artifacts, not evidence-grounded verdicts. The boundary date separates the two regimes in `rmr-report.mjs` output (`c3_semantic_boundary: "2026-07-03"`).

- **11 `--full` MCP tools deleted** (`skill_write`, `skill_recall`, `skill_list`, `dashboard_export`, `session_end_reflect`, `project_board`, `project_status`, `bootstrap_scan`, `bootstrap_import`, `memory_query`, `brief`). All had zero organic use across 2,649 transcripts (60-day corpus). CLI equivalents remain functional: `ar status`, `ar consolidate`, `ar bootstrap`, `ar recognition`. If any tool is required, use the CLI command or set `AR_EXTRAS=1` for the extras tier (13 tools).

- **`knowledge_write` routing redirect.** The `remember` MCP tool's `knowledgeWrite` routing path now redirects to the journal store. New content is no longer written to the `knowledge/` directory. Existing `knowledge/` files on disk are untouched.

### Added

- **C3: verdict taxonomy extended.** `CorrectionOutcome.kind` gains three new kinds: `"triggered"` (correction consulted via `check_action`), `"not_triggered"` (confirmed not relevant, dream-audit path only), `"unknown"` (no positive evidence — new default). Old readers that filter by `"retrieved" | "heeded" | "recurred"` are unaffected; new kinds are silently skipped.

- **C3: `check_action` records `"triggered"` outcomes.** Every correction matched by `checkAction()` gets a `"triggered"` event appended to `_outcomes.jsonl` (1/day dedup per correction). This is the authoritative trigger signal for session-end's `"heeded"` classification.

- **C3: verdict coverage metrics.** `getCorrectionKPIs()` and `rmr-report.mjs` now compute `verdict_coverage = (heeded + recurred + not_triggered) / injected` (canonical definition, consistent across both consumers). Also added: `triggered_count`, `unknown_count`, `not_triggered_count` to `CorrectionKPI`.

- **C3b: dream-audit verdict surface.** `ar outcomes audit-candidates` lists corrections whose verdict is still `"unknown"` for a given date. `ar outcomes record` writes a dream-audit verdict (`not_triggered | recurred | heeded`) with backdated `at` semantics. `"not_triggered"` is single-producer enforced at core level — `evidence` must start with `"dream-audit:"`.

- **C3b: `recorded_at` forensic anchor.** `recordOutcome()` now stamps `recorded_at: new Date().toISOString()` on every event unconditionally, diverging from the semantic `at` field when the dream backdates events. Pre-C3b jsonl lines lack `recorded_at`; old readers ignore unknown fields.

- **C2: injection diet.** Session-start correction payload reduced from ~2010 to 1489 median tokens. `SlimCorrection` shape strips KPI counter fields. Per-section char budgets enforced (`corrections_total` 1200 chars). P0 corrections unconditionally survive the cap (controlled overflow, not silent truncation). Context omitted when identical to rule or shorter by ≤20 chars.

- **L1: `MemoryBackend` write seam.** `MemoryBackend` interface (`retain()`, `available()`, `name()`) with `DisabledMemoryBackend` default (zero cloud egress until `AR_MEMORY_BACKEND` is set). `LocalArchiveMemoryBackend` reference implementation writes to `<root>/exports/local-archive/YYYY-MM-DD.json`. `ar corrections export --to-backend` opt-in flag. `SAFE_MODULE_RE` + `BUILTIN_DENYLIST` import-injection guards on `AR_MEMORY_BACKEND`.

- **L2: `ar scrub` CLI.** Reads stdin, writes scrubbed content to stdout. Exit codes: 0 clean/redacted, 1 (`--check` only) secrets found and scrubbable, 2 scrub-resistant residue (stdout empty on exit 2). Covers: AWS AKIA keys, GitHub `ghp_`/`ghs_`, OpenAI/Anthropic `sk-` keys, bidi override chars, prompt-injection tags. `Authorization: Bearer` headers are documented fail-open (tested with executable regression guard).

- **L2: corrections sync store.** `corrections` added to `syncToSupabase` store union behind double opt-in: `sync_personal === true` AND `sync_corrections === true` (via `AR_SYNC_CORRECTIONS=1`). Raw `CorrectionRecord` never reaches `doSync` directly — scrub upstream enforced via `exportCorrections()`.

- **P3a: `AR_EXTRAS=1` quarantine tier.** Third MCP surface tier for tools that are structurally sound but not default-path. 7 tools moved from `--full` to extras: `pipeline_open/close/list/current/show`, `register_rule`, `digest`. `tool-surface-purity.test.mjs` snapshot guard locks all 3 tiers: default 5 / `--full` 6 / `AR_EXTRAS` 13.

- **P2: harness-artifact early-exit.** `hook-ambient`, `hook-correction`, `hook-save` all exit 0 (silent) when stdin matches harness XML wrappers (`<task-notification>`, `<agent-message>`, `<system-reminder>`, `<parameter name="command">`, `<result>`, `<search_results>`, and 7 others). Fixed 18 of 23 noise cases found by census. `hook-correction` had no early-exit before this wave.

- **P2: `MAX_INJECT=2` cap and `BLIND_SPOT_DOMAIN_NOISE` 24-token filter.** Ambient hook injects at most 2 items per turn. Two noisy global blind-spot entries now require ≥24 distinctive domain tokens before firing (correction injection path unaffected).

- **Phase 0 artifacts.** `docs/research/agent-memory-landscape-2026-07.md` (market/literature scan) and `docs/proposals/2026-07-02-rmr-orchestration-plan.md` (RMR orchestration plan) committed as program of record.

- **M1 baseline artifacts.** `scripts/eval/rmr-report.mjs` (rerunnable) + `scripts/eval/baselines/rmr-baseline-2026-07-02.json` (frozen). Capture recall baseline: **35.3%** [17.3–58.7 bootstrap 95% CI], root cause: hook-no-fire (coverage bug, not classification bug). Pre-C3 heed rate: 96.9% — instrument-optimistic artifact.

- **D1-apply: measured-truth README.** Unfalsifiable marketing claims replaced with artifact-cited metrics table: capture recall 35.3% [CI], heed-rate N/A pending C3 data accumulation, verdict coverage 0/3 evidence-grounded, B2 bench gates green, 891 tests. `README.zh-CN.md` carries sync-pending note.

### Changed

- **C3: session-end heed loop redesigned.** The verdict determination order is now: (1) recurrence marker + trigger/topical evidence → `"recurred"`, (2) trigger evidence (check-action) + no recurrence → `"heeded"`, (3) topical overlap only or no evidence → `"unknown"`. The meta-content guard (`hasGenuineRecurrenceMarker`) applies sentence-level eval-vocabulary filtering to prevent AR's own measurement prose from producing false `"recurred"` verdicts.

- **`recordOutcome` early-return for ledger-only kinds.** `"triggered"`, `"not_triggered"`, `"unknown"` do not rewrite the denormalized `heeded_count`/`recurrence_count`/`precision` fields on the correction record. They are ledger events only, avoiding the lost-update race flagged in M1.

- **MCP surface reduced from 25 to 6 tools (default 5, `--full` 6).** After P3a quarantine and P3b deletions: default mode exposes `session_start`, `remember`, `recall`, `session_end`, `check`, `check_action` (in `--full`). `AR_EXTRAS=1` adds 7 more.

- **`knowledge_write` routing → journal.** `remember` MCP tool and `smart-remember.ts` no longer write to the `knowledge/` directory for new content. The routing path redirects to journal, closing the write-only graveyard identified by census. Existing `knowledge/` files on disk are preserved.

- **C0: npx +x hotfix.** `packages/mcp-server/package.json` build script changed to `tsc && chmod +x dist/server.js`. `tsc` does not preserve the execute bit; `npx agent-recall-mcp` silently failed since v3.4.21. Pack-test verified correct mode (0755 in tarball).

### Removed

- **11 `--full` MCP tool wrappers** (see BREAKING above): `skill_write`, `skill_recall`, `skill_list`, `dashboard_export`, `session_end_reflect`, `project_board`, `project_status`, `bootstrap_scan`, `bootstrap_import`, `memory_query`, `brief`.

- **4 orphaned tools-logic modules**: `packages/core/src/tools-logic/brief.ts`, `dashboard-export.ts`, `memory-query.ts`, `project-status.ts` — no CLI or SDK consumers remained after MCP wrapper deletion.

- **`arsave-quick` skill** (`~/.claude/commands/arsave-quick`): superseded by `arsave`; owner-approved.

- **Competitor comparison table, precision-KPI quote, stale benchmark link, 2 unanchored badges** from `README.md` (D1-apply). Unfalsifiable without measured data; owner-approved.

### Fixed

- **`outcomes-audit.test.mjs` TZ-naive date assertion.** Test was asserting `recorded_at` local-date against UTC `new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)`. Replaced with `todayStr()` (local-timezone). Pinned-date regression guard added.

- **`heeded-guard.mjs` updated for C3 semantics.** The benchmark previously asserted `heeded_count=1` after two same-day `sessionEnd` calls with an unrelated summary — pre-C3 default-heeded behavior now deliberately eliminated. T1 now exercises (a) the evidence-grounded path via `checkAction` → `sessionEnd` → `heeded=1`, and (b) the dead-code guard: `sessionEnd` with no trigger → `heeded=0`, outcome `"unknown"` (old default-heeded stays dead). 1/day dedup guard still exercised (T1c).

- **`hook-end-p3-backstop.test.mjs` flaky test isolation.** Root cause: the hook-end lockFile at `os.homedir()/.agent-recall/.hook-end-lock` is a global path shared across test files and persists between runs. Two races: (1) `hook-end-archive.test.mjs` and this file run concurrently under `node --test` (separate worker threads), writing to the same lockFile; (2) `nextSid()` produces a deterministic UUID sequence — a stale lock from a prior run matching the current test's sid causes run1 to silently exit 0 before any archive is written. Fix: `runHookEnd()` now passes `HOME=ISOLATED_HOME` (a per-file `mkdtempSync` dir) to each child process, so `os.homedir()` resolves to the isolated dir inside the hook. The `(c)` test's explicit lockFile deletion updated to target `ISOLATED_HOME/.agent-recall/.hook-end-lock`. `before()` and `after()` hooks clean up `ISOLATED_HOME`.
